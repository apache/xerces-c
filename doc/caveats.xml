	    <ul>
	        <li>SAXPrint does not output the &lt;?XML ... ?&gt; prologue 
				line (this means that it cannot process its own 
				output). This is because the SAX API doesn't provide 
				a callback handler for the prologue.</li>
	        <li>Only URL's of the form 'file://' are currently supported. 
				Others will be supported in future versions (we're adding 
				code to call libwww for this support).</li>
