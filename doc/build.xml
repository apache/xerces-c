        &XercesCName; comes with Microsoft Visual C++ projects and workspaces to
        help you build &XercesCName;. The following describes the steps you need
        to build &XercesCName;.

        <s3 title="Building &XercesCName; library">
            <p>To build &XercesCName; from it source (using MSVC), you will
            need to open the workspace containing the project. If you are
            building your application, you may want to add the &XercesCName;
            project inside your applications's workspace.</p>
            <p>The workspace containing the &XercesCName; project file and
            all other samples is:</p>
<source>&XercesCSrcInstallDir;\Projects\Win32\VC6\xerces-all\xerces-all.dsw</source>
            <p>Once you are inside MSVC, you need to build the project marked
            <em>XercesLib</em>.</p>
            <p>If you want to include the &XercesCName; project separately,
            you need to pick up:</p>
<source>&XercesCSrcInstallDir;\Projects\Win32\VC6\xerces-all\XercesLib\XercesLib.dsp</source>
            <p>You must make sure that you are linking your application with
            the &XercesCWindowsLib;.lib library and also make sure that
            the associated DLL is somewhere in your path.</p>
            <note>If you are working on the AlphaWorks version which uses ICU,
            you must either have the environment variable ICU_DATA set, or
            keep the international converter files relative to the
            &XercesCProjectName; DLL (as it came with  the original binary
            drop) for the program to find it. For finding out where you can
            get ICU from and build it, look at the last section of this page.</note>
        </s3>
        <s3 title="Building samples">
            <p>Inside the same workspace (xerces-all.dsw), you'll find several other
            projects. These are for the samples. Select all the samples and right click
            on the selection. Then choose "Build (selection only)" to build all the
            samples in one shot.</p>
        </s3>
    </s2>

    <anchor name="BuildUNIX"/>
    <s2 title="Building on UNIX platforms">
        <p>&XercesCName; uses
        <jump href="http://www.gnu.org">GNU</jump> tools like
        <jump href="http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/autoconf.html">Autoconf</jump> and
        <jump href="http://www.gnu.org/software/make/make.html">GNU Make</jump> to build the system. You must first make sure you
        have these tools installed on your system before proceeding.
        If you don not have required tools, ask your system administrator
        to get them for you. These tools are free under the GNU Public Licence
        and may be obtained from the
        <jump href="http://www.gnu.org">Free Software Foundation</jump>.</p>

        <p><em>Do not jump into the build directly before reading this.</em></p>

        <p>Spending some time reading the following instructions will save you a
        lot of wasted time and support-related e-mail communication.
        The &XercesCName; build instructions are a little different from
        normal product builds. Specifically, there are some wrapper-scripts
        that have been written to make life easier for you. You are free
        not to use these scripts and use
        <jump href="http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/autoconf.html">Autoconf</jump> and
        <jump href="http://www.gnu.org/software/make/make.html">GNU Make</jump>
        directly, but we want to make sure you know what you are by-passing and
        what risks you are taking. So read the following instructions
        carefully before attempting to build it yourself.</p>

        <p>Besides having all necessary build tools, you also need to know what
        compilers we have tested &XercesCName; on. The following table lists the
        relevant platforms and compilers.</p>

        <table>
            <tr><td><em>Operating System</em></td><td><em>Compiler</em></td></tr>
            <tr><td>Redhat Linux 6.1</td><td>egcs</td></tr>
            <tr><td>AIX 4.3.3  and higher</td><td>xlC</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Solaris 2.6</td><td>CC</td></tr>
            <tr><td>HP-UX 10.2</td><td>CC</td></tr>
            <tr><td>HP-UX 11</td><td>aCC</td></tr>
        </table>

        <p>If you are not using any of these compilers, you are taking a calculated risk
        by exploring new grounds. Your effort in making &XercesCName; work on this
        new compiler is greatly appreciated and any problems you face can be addressed
        on the &XercesCName; <jump href="mailto:&XercesCEmailAddress;">mailing list</jump>.
        </p>

        <p><em>Differences between the UNIX platforms:</em> The description below is
        generic, but as every programmer is aware, there are minor differences
        within the various UNIX flavors the world has been bestowed with.
        The one difference that you need to watch out in the discussion below,
        pertains to the system environment variable for finding libraries.
        On <em>Linux and Solaris</em>, the environment variable name is called
        <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code>, on <em>AIX</em> it is <code>LIBPATH</code>,
        while on <em>HP-UX</em> it is <code>SHLIB_PATH</code>. The following
        discussion assumes you are working on Linux, but it is with subtle
        understanding that you know how to interpret it for the other UNIX flavors.</p>

        <note>If you wish to build &XercesCName; with
        <jump href="http://www10.software.ibm.com/developerworks/opensource/icu/project/">ICU</jump>,
        look at the <link anchor="icu">last section</link> of this page.
        It tells you where you can find ICU and how you can build &XercesCName;
        to include the ICU internationalization library.</note>

        <s3 title="Setting build environment variables">
            <p>Before doing the build, you must first set your environment variables
            to pick-up the compiler and also specify where you extracted &XercesCName;
            on your machine.
            While the first one is probably set for you by the system administrator, just
            make sure you can invoke the compiler. You may do so by typing the
            compiler invocation command without any parameters (e.g. xlc_r, or g++, or cc)
            and check if you get a proper response back.</p>
            <p>Next set your &XercesCName; root path as follows:</p>
<source>export XERCESCROOT=&lt;full path to &XercesCSrcInstallDir;&gt;</source>

            <p>This should be the full path of the directory where you extracted &XercesCName;.</p>
            </s3>

        <s3 title="Building &XercesCName; library">
            <p>As mentioned earlier, you must be ready with the GNU tools like
            <jump href="http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/autoconf.html">autoconf</jump> and
            <jump href="http://www.gnu.org/software/make/make.html">gmake</jump>
            before you attempt the build.</p>

            <p>The autoconf tool is required on only one platform and produces
            a set of portable scripts (configure) that you can run on all
            other platforms without actually having the autoconf tool installed
            everywhere. In all probability the autoconf-generated script
            (called <code>configure</code>) is already in your <code>src</code>
            directory. If not, type:</p>

<source>cd $XERCESCROOT/src
autoconf</source>

            <p>This generates a shell-script called <code>configure</code>. It is tempting to run
            this script directly as is normally the case, but wait a minute. If you are
            using the default compilers like
            <jump href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gcc/gcc.html">gcc</jump> and
            <jump href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gcc/gcc.html">g++</jump> you do not have a problem. But
            if you are not on the standard GNU compilers, you need to export a few more
            environment variables before you can invoke configure.</p>

            <p>Rather than make you to figure out what strange environment
            variables you need to use, we have provided you with a wrapper
            script that does the job for you. All you need to tell the script
            is what your compiler is, and what options you are going to use
            inside your build, and the script does everything for you. Here
            is what the script takes as input:</p>

<source>runConfigure
runConfigure: Helper script to run "configure" for one of the
              supported platforms.
Usage: runConfigure "options"
       where options may be any of the following:
       -p &lt;platform&gt; (accepts 'aix', 'linux', 'solaris',
                            'hp-10', 'hp-11', 'irix', 'unixware')
       -c &lt;C compiler name&gt; (e.g. gcc, cc, xlc)
       -x &lt;C++ compiler name&gt; (e.g. g++, CC, xlC)
       -d (specifies that you want to build debug version)
       -m &lt;message loader&gt; can be 'inmem', 'icu', 'iconv'
       -n &lt;net accessor&gt; can be 'fileonly', 'libwww'
       -t &lt;transcoder&gt; can be 'icu' or 'native'
       -r &lt;thread option&gt; can be 'pthread' or 'dce' (only used on HP-11)
       -l &lt;extra linker options&gt;
       -z &lt;extra compiler options&gt;
       -h (to get help on the above commands)</source>

            <note>&XercesCName; builds as a standalone library and also as a library
            dependent on International Components for Unicode (ICU). For simplicity,
            the following discussion only targets standalone builds.</note>

            <p>One of the common ways to build &XercesCName; is as follows:</p>

<source>runConfigure -plinux -cgcc -xg++ -minmem -nfileonly -tnative</source>

            <p>The response will be something like this:</p>

In future, you may also directly type the following commands to
create the Makefiles.

export TRANSCODER=NATIVE
export MESSAGELOADER=INMEM
export USELIBWWW=0
export CC=gcc
export CXX=g++
export CXXFLAGS=-O -DXML_USE_NATIVE_TRANSCODER -DXML_USE_INMEM_MESSAGELOADER
export CFLAGS=-O -DXML_USE_NATIVE_TRANSCODER -DXML_USE_INMEM_MESSAGELOADER
export LIBS= -lpthread
configure

If the result of the above commands look OK to you, go to the directory
$XERCESCROOT/src and type "gmake" to make the XERCES-C system.</source>

            <p>So now you see what the wrapper script has actually been doing! It has
            invoked <code>configure</code>
            to create the Makefiles in the individual sub-directories, but in addition
            to that, it has set a few environment variables to correctly configure
            your compiler and compiler flags too.</p>

            <p>Now that the Makefiles are all created, you are ready to do the actual build.</p>

<source>gmake</source>

            <p>Is that it? Yes, that's all you need to build &XercesCName;.</p>
        </s3>

        <s3 title="Building samples">
            <p>Similarly, you can build the samples by giving the same commands in the
            <code>samples</code> directory.</p>

<source>cd $XERCESCROOT/samples
runConfigure -plinux -cgcc -xg++
gmake</source>

            <p>The samples get built in the <code>bin</code> directory. Before you run the
            samples, you must make sure that your library path is set to pick up
            libraries from <code>$XERCESCROOT/lib</code>. If not, type the following to
            set your library path properly.</p>

<source>export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$XERCESCROOT/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH</source>
            <p>You are now set to run the sample applications.</p>

                <p><em>Recommendations:</em></p>

                <ul>
				<li>There are a couple of options when building the XML4C parser on AS/400.
				For messaging support, you can use the in memory message option or the
				message file support. For code page translation, you can use the AS/400
				native Iconv400 support or ICU. If you choose ICU, follow the instructions
				to build the ICU service program with the ICU download. Those instructions
				are not included here.</li>

    			<li>Currently we recommend that you take the options of MsgFile and
    			Iconv400 (see below)</li>
                </ul>

                <p><em>Setup Instructions:</em></p>

				<ul>
				<li>Make sure that you have the requirements installed on your AS/400.
				We highly recommend that you read the writeup that accompanies the gnu
				facilities download.  There are install instructions as well as
				information about how modules, programs and service programs can be
				created in Unix-like fashion using gnu utilities.  Note that symbolic
				links are use in the file system to point to actual AS/400 <code>*module</code>,
				<code>*pgm</code> and <code>*srvpgm</code> objects in libraries.</li>
				<li>Download the tar file  (unix version) to the AS/400
				(using a mapped drive), and decompress and <code>untar</code> the source.
				We have had difficulty with the tar command on AS/400. This is under
				investigation.  If you have trouble, we recommend the following work
				around:</li></ul>
<source>
qsh:
gunzip -d &lt;tar file.gz&gt;
pax -r -f &lt;uncompressed tar file&gt;</source>

				<ul>
				<li>Create AS400 target library. This library will be the target
				for the resulting  modules and  &XercesCName; service program. You will
				specify this library on the <code>OUTPUTDIR</code> environment variable
				in step 4</li>
				<li>Set up the following environment variables in your build process
				(use <code>ADDENVVAR</code> or <code>WRKENVVAR CL</code> commands):</li>
				</ul>
<source>
XERCESCROOT - &lt;the full path to your &XercesCName; sources&gt;
PLATFORM  - 'OS400'
MAKE   - '/usr/bin/gmake'
OUTPUTDIR  - &lt;identifies target as400 library for *module, *pgm and *srvpgm objects&gt;
ICUROOT - (optional if using ICU)  &lt;the path of your ICU includes&gt;</source>

				<ul>
				<li>Add <code>QCXXN</code>, to your build process library list.
				This results in the resolution of <code>CRTCPPMOD</code> used by the
				<code>icc</code> compiler.</li>

				<li>The runConfigure instruction below uses <code>'egrep'</code>.
				This is not on the AS/400 but you can create it by doing the following:
				<code>edtf '/usr/bin/egrep'</code> with the following source:</li>
				</ul>

<source>
#!/usr/bin/sh
/usr/bin/grep -e "$@"</source>

<p>You may want to put the environment variables and library list
setup instructions in a <code>CL</code> program so you will not forget these steps
during your build.</p>

<p><em>Configure</em></p>

<p>To configure the make files for an AS/400 build do the following:</p>
<source>
qsh
cd &lt;full path to &XercesCName;&gt;/src
runConfigure -p os400 -x icc -c icc -m MsgFile -t Iconv400</source>

<p>Troubleshooting:</p>
<source>error: configure: error: installation or configuration problem:
C compiler cannot create executables.</source>

<p>If during <code>runConfigure</code> you see the above error message, it
can mean one of two things. Either <code>QCXXN</code> is not on your library
list  <em>OR</em> the <code>runConfigure</code> cannot create the temporary
modules (<code>CONFTest1</code>, etc) it uses to test out the compiler
options. The second reason happens because the test modules already exist
from a previous run of <code>runConfigure</code>. To correct the problem,
do the following:</p>
<source>
DLTMOD &lt;your OUTPUTDIR library&gt;/CONFT* and
DLTPGM your &lt;OUTPUTDIR library&gt;/CONFT*</source>

<p><em>Build</em></p>

<source>
qsh
gmake -e</source>

<p>The above gmake will result in a service program being created
in your specified library and a symbolic link to that service program
placed in &lt;path to &XercesCName;/lib&gt;. You can either bind your
XML application programs directly to the parser's service program
via the <code>BNDSRVPGM</code> option on the <code>CRTPGM</code> or
<code>CRTSRVPGM</code> command  or you can specify a binding directory
on your <code>icc</code>  command. To specify an archive file to bind to,
use the  <code>-L, -l</code> binding options on icc.  An archive file
on AS/400 is a binding directory. To create an archive file, use
<code>qar</code> command.  (see the gnu facilities write up).
</p>

<p>
After building the &XercesCName; service program, create a binding directory
by doing the following (note, this binding directory is used when building
the samples):</p>
<source>
qsh
cd &lt;full path to &XercesCName;>/lib&gt;
qar -cuv libxercesc1_1.a *.o
command = CRTBNDDIR BNDDIR(yourlib/libxercesc) TEXT('/yourlib/&XercesCName;/lib/libxercesc1_1.a')
command = ADDBNDDIRE BNDDIR(yourlib/libxercesc) OBJ((yourlib/LIBXERCESC *SRVPGM) )</source>


<p><em>Troubleshooting:</em></p>
<p>If you are on a V4R3 system, you will get a bind problem
<code>'descriptor  QlgCvtTextDescToDesc not found'</code> using Iconv400.
On V4R3 the system doesn't automatically pick up the <code>QSYS/QLGUSR</code> service
program for you when resolving this function. This is not the case on V4R4.
To fix this, you can either manually create the service program after creating
all the resulting modules in your &lt;OUTPUTDIR&gt; library or you can create
a symbolic link to a binding directory that points to  the <code>QLGUSR</code>
service program and then specify  an additional <code>-L, -l</code> on the
<code>EXTRA_LINK_OPTIONS</code> in <code>Makefile.incl</code>.
See the <code>ln</code> and <code>qar</code> function in the gnu utilities.</p>

<p>To build for transcoder ICU:</p>
<ol>
 <li>Make sure you have an <code>ICUROOT</code> path set up so that you can
 find the ICU header files (usually <code>/usr/local</code>)</li>
 <li>Make sure you have created a binding directory (symbolic link)
 in the file system so that you can bind the &XercesCName; service program
 to the ICU service program and specify that on the <code>EXTRA_LINK_OPTIONS</code>
 in <code>src/Makefile.incl</code> (usually the default is a link
 in <code>/usr/local/lib</code>).</li>
</ol>

<p><em>Creating AS400 XML parser message file:</em></p>
<p>As specified earlier, the <code>-m</code> MsgFile support on the
<code>runConfigure</code> enable the parser messages to be pulled from
an AS/400 message file. To view the source for creating  the message file
and the XML parser messages, see the following stream file:</p>
<source>
EDTF &lt;full path to &XercesCName;&gt;/src/util/MsgLoaders/MsgFile/CrtXMLMsgs</source>

<p>In the prolog of <code>CrtXMLMsgs</code> there are instructions to create
the message file:</p>
<ol>
<li>Use the <code>CPYFRMSTMF</code> to copy the CL source to an AS/400 source
physical file. Note that the target source file needs to have record length
of about 200 bytes to avoid any truncation.</li>
<li>Create the CL program to create the message file and add the various
message descriptions</li>
<li>Call the CL program, providing the name of the message file
(use <code>QXMLMSG</code> as default) and a library  (this can be any
library, including any product library in which you wish to embed
the xml parser)</li>
</ol>

<p>Note that the &XercesCName; source code for resolving parser messages is
using by default message file  <code>QXMLMSG, *LIBL</code>.
If you want to change either the message file name or explicitly qualify the
library to match your product needs, you must edit the following <code>.cpp</code>
files prior to your build.</p>
<source>
&lt;full path to &XercesCName;&gt;/src/util/MsgLoaders/MsgFile/MsgLoader.cpp
&lt;full path to &XercesCName;&gt;/src/util/Platforms/OS400/OS400PlatformUtils.cpp</source>

<p><em>Troubleshooting:</em></p>
<p>If you are using the parser and are failing to get any  message text
for error codes, it may be because of the <code>*LIBL</code> resolution
of the message file.</p>
</s3>

<s3 title="Building Samples on AS/400">
<source>
qsh
cd &lt;full path to &XercesCName;&gt;/samples
runConfigure -p os400 -x icc -c icc
gmake -e</source>

<p><em>Troubleshooting:</em></p>
<p>If you take a <code>'sed'</code> error, while trying to make the samples.
This is an AS400 anomaly having to do with certain new line character and
the <code>sed</code> function. A temporary work around is to use <code>EDTF</code>
on the configure stream file (<code>../samples/configure</code>) and delete the
following line near the bottom: <code>s%@DEFS@%$DEFS%g</code>.

                <li><em>Move the new folders:</em>
                    <br/>move the newly created &XercesCName; and icu124
                    folders to the "src drop" folder.</li>

                <li><em>Drag and drop:</em>
                    <br/>the &XercesCName; folder into the "rename file" application located in
                    the same folder as this readme.
                    <br/>This is a MacPerl script that renames files that have
                    names too long to fit in a HFS/HFS+ filesystem.
                    It also searches through all of the source code and changes
                    the #include statements to refer to the new file names.</li>

                <li><em>Move the MacOS folder:</em>
                    <br/>from the in the Projects folder to "src drop:&XercesCName;:Projects".</li>

                <li><em>Binary distribution:</em>
                <br/>If you wish, you can create projects for and build the rest of the tools and test
                suites.  They are not needed if you just want to use &XercesCName;. I suggest that you
                use the binary data files distributed with the binary distribution of ICU instead of
                creating your own from the text data files in the ICE source distribution.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>There are some things to be aware of when creating your own
            projects using &XercesCName;.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>You will need to link against both the ICU and &XercesCName; libraries.</li>
                <li>The options "Always search user paths" and "Interpret DOS and Unix Paths" are
                    very useful.  Some of the code won't compile without them set.</li>
                <li>Most of the tools and test code will require slight modification to compile and run
                    correctly (typecasts, command line parameters, etc), but it is possible to get
                    them working correctly.</li>
                <li>You will most likely have to set up the Access Paths.  The access paths in the
                    &XercesCName; projects should serve as a good example.</li>

    <s2 title="How to Build ICU">
        <p>As mentioned earlier, &XercesCName; may be built in stand-alone mode using
        native encoding support and also using ICU where you get support for 100's
        of encodings. ICU stands for International Components for Unicode and is an
        open source distribution from IBM. You can get
        <jump href="http://www10.software.ibm.com/developerworks/opensource/icu/project/">ICU libraries</jump> from
        <jump href="http://www.ibm.com/developerWorks">IBM's developerWorks site</jump>

        <jump href="http://www10.software.ibm.com/developerworks/opensource/icu/project/download/index.html">download page</jump>
        directly.</p>
        <s3 title="Buiding ICU for &XercesCName;">
            <p>You can find generic instructions to build ICU in the ICU documentation.
            What we describe below are the minimal steps needed to build ICU for &XercesCName;.
            Not all ICU components need to be built to make it work with &XercesCName;.</p>

            <note><em>Important:</em> Please remember that <em>ICU and
            &XercesCName; must be built with the same compiler</em>,
            preferably with the same version. You cannot for example,
            build ICU with a threaded version of the xlC compiler and
            build &XercesCName; with a non-threaded one.</note>
        </s3>

        <s3 title="Building ICU on Windows">
            <p>To build ICU from its source, invoke the project
            <code>\icu\source\allinone\allinone.dsw</code>
            and build the sub-project labeled <code>common</code>.
            You may also want to build <code>tools/makeconv</code> to make
            the converter tool. All others are not required for the &XercesCName;
            build to proceed.</p>

            <p>To build &XercesCName; from it source, you will need to
            include a project file in your workspace to program your
            application. Otherwise, you can use the provided workspace and add
            your application to it as a separate project.</p>

            <p>In the first case the project file is:
            <code>xml4c2\Projects\Win32\VC6\IXXML4C2\IXXML4C2\IXXML4C2.dsp</code></p>

            <p>In the second case the workspace is:
            <code>xml4c2\Projects\Win32\VC6\IXXML4C2\IXXML4C2.dsw</code></p>

            <p>You must make sure that you are linking your application
            with the &XercesCWindowsLib;.lib library and also make sure
            that the associated DLL is somewhere in your path. Note
            that you must either have the environment variable
            <code>ICU_DATA</code> set, or keep the international converter
            files relative to the &XercesCProjectName; DLL (as it came with
            the original binary drop) for the program to find it.</p>

        <s3 title="Building ICU on UNIX platforms">

            <p>To build ICU on all UNIX platforms you at least need the
            <code>autoconf</code> tool and GNU's <code>gmake</code> utility.</p>

            <p>First make sure that you have defined the following
            environment variables:</p>

<source>export ICUROOT = &lt;icu_installdir&gt;
export ICU_DATA = &lt;icu_installdir&gt;/data/</source>

            <p>Next, go to the directory, the following commands will create
            a shell script called 'configure': </p>

<source>cd $ICUROOT
cd source
autoconf</source>

            <p>Commands for specific UNIX platforms are different and are
            described separately below.</p>

            <p>You will get a more detailed description of the use of
            configure in the ICU documentation. The differences lie in the
            arguments passed to the configure script, which is a
            platform-independent generated shell-script (through
            <code>autoconf</code>) and is used to generate platform-specific
            <code>Makefiles</code> from generic <code>Makefile.in</code> files.</p>

            <p><em>For AIX:</em></p>

        <p>The user documentation (this very page that you are reading
        on the browser right now), was generated using an XML
        application called StyleBook. This application makes use of
        Xerces-J and Xalan to create the HTML file from the XML source
        files. The XML source files for the documentation are part of
        the &XercesCName; module. These files reside in the
        <code>doc</code> directory.</p>

        <p><em>Pre-requisites for building the user
        documentation are:</em></p>

        <ul>
          <li>JDK 1.2.2 (or later).</li>
          <li>Xerces-J (1.0.0 or later).</li>
          <li>Xalan (0.19.3 or later)</li>
          <li>Stylebook 1.0-b2</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Setup PATH to include the JDK 1.2.2 bin directory. Also setup
        CLASSPATH environment variable as follows:</p>

        <ul>

          <li>Under Windows (assumes all jars are in '\jars'
          directory:)<br/>
          <code>CLASSPATH=\jars\stylebook-1.0-b2.jar;\jars\xalan.jar;\jars\xerces.jar</code></li>

          <li>Under Unix's (assumes all jars are in '~/jars' directory):<br/>
          <code>export CLASSPATH="~/jars/stylebook-1.0-b2.jar:~/jars/xalan.jar:~/jars/xerces.jar"</code></li>
        </ul>

        <p>Next, cd to the &XercesCName; source drop root directory,

        <ul>
          <li>Under Windows:<br/>
          <code>createDocs</code></li>
          <li>Under Unix's:<br/>
          <code>sh createDocs.bat</code></li>
        </ul>

        <p>This should generate the .html files in the 'doc/html'
        directory.</p>

        <p><em>Ok here is where you can get the three jar files that are

    <s2 title="I wish to port &XercesCProjectName; to my favourite platform. Do you have any suggestions?">

      <p>All platform dependent code in &XercesCProjectName; has been
      isolated to a couple of files, which should ease the porting
      effort.  Here are the basic steps that should be followed to
      port &XercesCProjectName;.</p>

      <ol>

        <li>The directory 'src/util/Platforms' contains the
        platform sensitive files while 'src/util/Compilers' contains
        all development environment sensitive files. Each operating
        system has a file of its own and each development environment
        has another one of its own too.

        <br/>

        As an example, the Win32 platform as a Win32Defs.hpp file
        and the Visual C++ environment has a <code>VCPPDefs.hpp</code> file.
        These files set up certain define tokens, typedefs,
        constants, etc... that will drive the rest of the code to
        do the right thing for that platform and development
        environment. AIX/CSet have their own <code>AIXDefs.hpp</code> and
        <code>CSetDefs.hpp</code> files, and so on. You should create new
        versions of these files for your platform and environment
        and follow the comments in them to set up your own.
        Probably the comments in the Win32 and Visual C++ will be
        the best to follow, since that is where the main
        development is done.</li>

        <li>Next, edit the file XML4CDefs.hpp , which is where all
            of the fundamental stuff comes into the system. You will
            see conditional sections in there where the above
            per-platform and per-environment headers are brought in.
            Add the new ones for your platform under the appropriate
            conditionals.</li>

        <li>Now edit 'AutoSense.hpp'. Here we set canonical &XercesCProjectName;
            internal #define tokens which indicate the platform and
            compiler. These definitions are based on known platform
            and compiler defines.
            <br/>
            AutoSense.hpp is included in XML4CDefs.hpp and the
            canonical platform and compiler settings thus defined will
            make the particular platform and compiler headers to be
            the included at compilation.
            <br/>
            It might be a little tricky to decipher this file so be
            careful. If you are using say another compiler on Win32,
            probably it will use similar tokens so that the platform
            will get picked up already using what is already there.</li>

        <li>Once this is done, you will then need to implement a
            version of the 'platform utilities' for your platform.
            Each operating system has a file which implements some
            methods of the XMLPlatformUtils class, specific to that
            operating system. These are not terribly complex, so it
            should not be a lot of work. The Win32 verions is called
            Win32PlatformUtils.cpp, the AIX version is
            AIXPlatformUtils.cpp and so on. Create one for your
            platform, with the correct name, and empty out all of the
            implementation so that just the empty shells of the
            methods are there (with dummy returns where needed to make
            the compiler happy.) Once you've done that, you can start
            to get it to build without any real implementation.</li>

        <li>Once you have the system building, then start
            implementing your own platform utilties methods. Follow
            the comments in the Win32 version as to what they do, the
            comments will be improved in subsequent versions, but they
            should be fairly obvious now. Once you have these
            implementations done, you should be able to start
            debugging the system using the demo programs.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>That is the work required in a nutshell!</p>

    <s2 title="What should I define XMLCh to be?">

        <p>The answer is 'it depends'. We will mention some of the
        quirks that affect this decision. Hopefully, after reading
        whats below, you will be able to best decide what the right
        definition should be. We could not however, resist making a
        suggestion. Some observations first:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Xerces-C uses XMLCh as the fundamental type to hold
          one Unicode character as, all processing inside Xerces-C
          happens in Unicode.</li>

          <li>Most modern C++ compilers today provide 'wchar_t' as a
          fundamental type representing a 'wide character'. Most of them
          define it in using a typedef. This typedef definition is not
          consistent on all the platforms that we have come across.</li>

          <li>The size of wchar_t varies among the various compilers. Its
          either 16-bit or 32-bit. Fortunately, this only affects how
          much memory you need, to process the XML data, while everything
          is still in memory.</li>

          <li>Again on most platforms wchar_t represents a unicode
          character. HPUX, is one exception to this, that we know,
          where wchar_t <em>does not</em> represent a unicode
          character, rather its a native wide character.</li>

          <li>Lastly, most OS's/compilers provide a system library to
          manipulate wide character strings taking wchar_t and
          wchar_t* arguments. Most applications which support
          wide-characters make these system calls.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Our suggestion is:</p>

        <p>If your compiler defines wchar_t to represent a unicode
        character, then define XMLCh to be wchar_t.  Such a definition
        will allow you to pass the data returned by the parser (all
        api's return XMLCh, which is wchar_t) directly to the
        wide-character system api's for i/o or manipulation. This is
        most efficient and convenient.</p>

        <p>However, if your compiler defines wchar_t to be just a
        wide-character which is not Unicode, then define XMLCh to be
        unsigned short. For the Xerces-C parser, XMLCh is always
        Unicode. By defining it to be unsigned short and not wchar_t,
        the compiler will not let you accidently pass what is
        returned, via the parser API's, directly to the wide-character
        library calls. To use the wide-character library of functions,
        you will have to in your application, call some transcoding
        function which will convert it from Unicode to the native
        wide-character form. Again, if your application desires for
        whatever reason, you may define XMLCh to be 'unsigned
        long'. By doing so, you have just doubled the memory required
        to process the XML file.</p>

        <p>Hopefully, you will agree that the answer 'it depends' was
        the right one.</p>

    <anchor name="BuildUsingLibWWW"/>
    <s2 title="How can I generate Xerces-C binaries which includes the
               sample NetAccessor implementation using Libwww?">

      <p>This sample implementation has only been minimally tested
      only under Windows NT using Libwww 5.2.8. We have not stress
      tested our implementation can cannot guarantee that there are no
      memory leaks. The error reporting is also not adequate. Further,
      it only handles HTTP style URL's. As you can see, this
      implementation is only for illustrative purposes. Much more work
      is required to have a robust cross-platform implementation. We
      would welcome any volunteers who would contribute code to make
      this happen on various platforms.</p>

      <p>The software that you need are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>You need the &XercesCName; source archive for Windows.</li>
        <li>LibWWW 5.2.8. Win32 binaries are available at: <jump
        href="http://www.idm.ru/libwww.htm">http://www.idm.ru/libwww.htm</jump>.
        Source archives and other details on LibWWW are available at <jump
        href="http://www.w3.org/Library/">http://www.w3.org/Library/</jump>.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>All required changes in Xerces-C are restricted to the Project file
      settings for the XercesLib. To simplify, we will make certain assumptions
      about how LibWWW binaries (.lib) and header files are installed on your
      machine.</p>

     <ol>

       <li>First generate all the LibWWW binaries by using the project
       file supplied. Create a top level (say) <code>\libWWW</code>
       directory on the same disk drive where you installed the
       Xerces-C sources.  Copy all the <code>.lib</code> files to
       <code>\libWWW\lib</code> directory. Next, copy all the
       <code>.dll</code> files to <code>\libWWW\bin</code> directory
       and all the header (<code>*.h</code>) files to
       <code>\libWWW\include</code> directory.</li>

       <li>Next make the following changes to the Xerces-C lib project
       settings. Invoke the project settings dialog box.</li>

       <ol>
         <li>In the 'C/C++ : Preprocessor : Preprocessor definitions' add
         <code>XML_USE_NETACCESSOR_LIBWWW</code></li>

         <li>In the 'C/C++ : Preprocessor : Additional include directories' add
         <code>\libWWW\include</code>.</li>

       </ol>

       <li>Next, rather than listing all the 20 some LibWWW .lib files in the
       link settings, add them as external files to the XercesLib project.
       Right-Click on 'XercesLib files' and choose the 'Add Files to Project'
       menu item. Next choose all the *.lib files in \libWWW\lib directory and
       press 'ok'.</li>

       <li>Next, create a new sub-folder in XercesLib:util folder, by
       right-clicking on 'util' and choosing 'New Folder'. Call it 'libWWW'.</li>

       <li>Add netaccessor files into this 'libWWW' folder again, by
       right-clicking on 'libWWW' folder and choosing 'Add Files to
       Folder'.  Choose the four files in
       <code>&lt;XercesCRoot&gt;\src\util\NetAccessors</code>
       directory.  These files are: <code>BinURLInputStream.[ch]pp and
       LibWWWNetAccessor.[ch]pp</code>.</li>

       <li>Rebuild the Xerces-C library.</li>

     </ol>

     <p>Make sure you have <code>\libWWW\bin</code> in your
     <code>PATH</code> environment variable, before you run the
     samples and refer to a XML file containing HTTP URL's to remote
     resources.</p>
