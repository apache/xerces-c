    <s2 title="PParse">
        <p>PParse demonstrates progressive parsing.</p>
        <p>In this example, the programmer doesn't have to depend upon throwing
            an exception to terminate the parsing operation. Calling parseFirst() will
            cause the DTD to be parsed (both internal and external subsets) and any
            pre-content, i.e. everything up to but not including the root element.
            Subsequent calls to parseNext() will cause one more piece of markup to
            be parsed, and spit out from the core scanning code to the parser. You
            can quit the parse any time by just not calling parseNext() anymore
            and breaking out of the loop. When you call parseNext() and the end
            of the root element is the next piece of markup, the parser will
            continue on to the end of the file and return false, to let you
			know that the parse is done.</p>

        <s3 title="Building on Windows">
	        <p>Load the &XercesCInstallDir;win32\samples\Projects\Win32\VC6\samples.dsw
	        Microsoft Visual C++ workspace inside your MSVC IDE. Then
	        build the project marked PParse.</p>
        </s3>

        <s3 title="Building on UNIX">
<source>cd &XercesCInstallDir;-linux/samples
./runConfigure -p&lt;platform&gt; -c&lt;C_compiler&gt; -x&lt;C++_compiler&gt;
cd PParse
gmake</source>
	        <p>This will create the object files in the current directory
			and the executable named PParse in ' &XercesCInstallDir;-linux/bin'
			directory.</p>

	        <p>To delete all the generated object files and executables, type:</p>
<source>gmake clean</source>
        </s3>

        <s3 title="Running PParse">
        	<p>The program looks for the first 16 elements of the XML file,
			and reports if successful.</p>
<source>PParse [-v] &lt;XML file&gt;</source>
          	<p>The output is the following:</p>
<source>Got the required 16 elements.</source>
