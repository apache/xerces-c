    <faq title="Why does my application crash on AIX when I run it under a
         multi-threaded environment?">

      <q>Why does my application crash on AIX when I run it under a
        multi-threaded environment?</q>

      <a>
        <p>AIX maintains two kinds of libraries on the system,
          thread-safe and non-thread safe. Multi-threaded libraries on
          AIX follow a different naming convention, Usually the
          multi-threaded library names are followed with "_r". For
          example, libc.a is single threaded whereas libc_r.a is
          multi-threaded.</p>

        <p>To make your multi-threaded application run on AIX, you
          MUST ensure that you do not have a 'system library path' in
          your LIBPATH environment variable when you run the
          application. The appropriate libraries (threaded or
          non-threaded) are automatically picked up at runtime. An
          application usually crashes when you build your application
          for multi-threaded operation but don't point to the
          thread-safe version of the system libraries. For example,
          LIBPATH can be simply set as:</p>

<source>LIBPATH=$HOME/&lt;&XercesCProjectName;&gt;/lib</source>

        <p>Where &lt;&XercesCProjectName;&gt; points to the directory where
          &XercesCProjectName; application resides.</p>

        <p>If for any reason, unrelated to &XercesCProjectName;, you need to
          keep a 'system library path' in your LIBPATH environment
          variable, you must make sure that you have placed the
          thread-safe path before you specify the normal system
          path. For example, you must place <ref>/lib/threads</ref> before
          <ref>/lib</ref> in your LIBPATH variable. That is to say your
          LIBPATH may look like this:</p>

<source>export LIBPATH=$HOME/&lt;&XercesCProjectName;&gt;/lib:/usr/lib/threads:/usr/lib</source>

        <p>Where /usr/lib is where your system libraries are.</p>

  <faq title="I cannot run my sample applications. What is wrong?">

    <q>I cannot run my sample applications. What is wrong?</q>
    <a>
      <p>In order to run an application built using &XercesCProjectName; you
      must set up your path and library search path properly. In the
      standalone version from Apache, you must have the &XercesCName; runtime library
      available from your path settings. On Windows this library is called
      <code>&XercesCWindowsLib;.dll</code> which must be available from your <code>PATH</code>
      settings. On UNIX platforms the library is called <code>&XercesCUnixLib;.so</code>
      (or <code>.a</code> or <code>.sl</code>) which must be available from your
      <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> (or <code>SHLIB_PATH</code> or <code>LIBPATH</code>)
	  environment variable.</p>

      <p>Thus, if you installed your binaries under <code>$HOME/fastxmlparser</code>,
      you need to point your library path to that directory.
      </p>

<source>export LIBPATH=$LIBPATH:$HOME/fastxmlparser/lib # (AIX)
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$HOME/fastxmlparser/lib # (Solaris, Linux)
export SHLIB_PATH=$SHLIB_PATH:$HOME/fastxmlparser/lib # (HP-UX)</source>

      <p>If you are using the enhanced version of this parser from IBM, you will need to
      put in two additional DLLs. In the Windows build these are <code>icuuc.dll</code> and
      <code>icudata.dll</code> which must be available from your PATH settings. On UNIX,
      these libraries are called <code>libicu-uc.so</code> and <code>libicudata.so</code>
      (or <code>.sl</code> for HP-UX or <code>.a</code> for AIX) which must be available from
      your library search path.

  <faq title="I just built my own application using the &XercesCProjectName; parser. Why does it
       crash?">

    <q>I just built my own application using the &XercesCProjectName; parser. Why does it
      crash?</q>
    <a>
      <p>In order to work with the &XercesCProjectName; parser, you have to
        first initialize the XML subsystem. The most common mistake is
        to forget this initialization. Before you make any calls to
        &XercesCProjectName; APIs, you must call</p>

<source>XMLPlatformUtils::Initialize():
try {
   XMLPlatformUtils::Initialize();
}
catch (const XMLException&amp; toCatch) {
   // Do your failure processing here
}</source>

      <p>This initializes the &XercesCProjectName; system and sets its
        internal variables.  Note that you must the include
        <code>util/PlatformUtils.hpp</code> file for this to work.</p>

  <faq title="Is &XercesCProjectName; thread-safe?">

    <q>Is &XercesCProjectName; thread-safe?</q>

    <a>
      <p>This is not a question that has a simple yes/no answer. Here are
        the rules for using &XercesCProjectName; in a multi-threaded environment:</p>

      <p>Within an address space, an instance of the parser may be used
        without restriction from a single thread, or an instance of the
        parser can be accessed from multiple threads, provided the
        application guarantees that only one thread has entered a method
        of the parser at any one time.</p>

      <p>When two or more parser instances exist in a process, the
        instances can be used concurrently, and without external
        synchronization.  That is, in an application containing two
        parsers and two threads, one pareser can be running within the
        first thread concurrently with the second parser running
        within the second thread.</p>

      <p>The same rules apply to &XercesCProjectName; DOM documents -
        multiple document instances may be concurrently accessed from
        different threads, but any given document instance can only be
        accessed by one thread at a time.</p>

      <p>DOMStrings allow multiple concurrent readers.  All DOMString
        const methods are thread safe, and can be concurrently entered
        by multiple threads.  Non-const DOMString methods, such as
        appendData(), are not thread safe and the application must
        guarantee that no other methods (including const methods) are
        executed concurrently with them.</p>

    <faq title="Why does my multi-threaded application crash on Solaris?">
        <q>Why does my multi-threaded application crash on Solaris?</q>
        <a>
            <p>The problem appears because the throw call on Solaris 2.6
            is not multi-thread safe. Sun Microsystems provides a patch to
            solve this problem. To get the latest patch for solving this
            problem, go to <jump href="http://sunsolve.sun.com">SunSolve.sun.com</jump>
            and get the appropriate patch for your operating system.
            For Intel machines running Solaris, you need to get Patch ID 104678.
            For SPARC machines you need to get Patch ID #105591.</p>

    <faq title="How do I find out what version of &XercesCProjectName; I am using?">
        <q>How do I find out what version of &XercesCProjectName; I am using?</q>
        <a>
      <p>The version string for &XercesCProjectName; happens to be in one of
        the source files. Look inside the file
        <code>src/util/XML4CDefs.hpp</code> and find out what the
        static variable <code>gXML4CFullVersionStr</code> is defined
        to be. (It is usually of type 3.0.0 or something
        similar). This is the version of XML you are using.</p>

      <p>If you don't have the source code, you have to find the version
        information from the shared library name. On Windows NT/95/98
        right click on the DLL name &XercesCWindowsLib;.dll in the bin directory
        and look up properties. The version information may be found on
        the Version tab.</p>

      <p>On AIX, just look for the library name &XercesCUnixLib;.a (or
        &XercesCUnixLib;.so on Solaris/Linux and &XercesCUnixLib;.sl on
        HP-UX).  The version number is coded in the name of the
        library.</p>

  <faq title="How do I uninstall &XercesCProjectName;?">
    <q>How do I uninstall &XercesCProjectName;?</q>
    <a>
      <p>&XercesCProjectName; only installs itself in a single directory and
        does not set any registry entries. Thus, to un-install, you
        only need to remove the directory where you installed it, and
        all &XercesCProjectName; related files will be removed.</p>

  <faq title="How are entity reference nodes handled in DOM?">
    <q>How are entity reference nodes handled in DOM?</q>
    <a>
      <p>If you are using the native DOM classes, the function
        <code>setExpandEntityReferences</code> controls how entities appear in the
        DOM tree. When setExpandEntityReferences is set to false (the
        default), an occurance of an entity reference in the XML
        document will be represented by a subtree with an
        EntityReference node at the root whose children represent the
        entity expansion. Entity expansion will be a DOM tree
        representing the structure of the entity expansion, not a text
        node containing the entity expansion as text.</p>

      <p>If setExpandEntityReferences is true, an entity reference in the
        XML document is represented by only the nodes that represent the
        entity expansion. The DOM tree will not contain any
        entityReference nodes.</p>

  <faq title="What kinds of URLs are currently supported in &XercesCProjectName;?">
    <q>What kinds of URLs are currently supported in &XercesCProjectName;?</q>
    <a>

    <p>The <code>XMLURL</code> class provides for limited URL support. It understands
    the <code>file://, http://</code>, and <code>ftp://</code> URL types, and is
    capable or parsing them into their constituent components, and normalizing
    them. It also supports the commonly required action of conglomerating a
    base and relative URL into a single URL. In other words, it performs the
    limited set of functions required by an XML parser.</p>

    <p>Another thing that URLs commonly do are to create an input stream that
    provides access to the entity referenced. The parser, as shipped, only
    supports this functionality on URLs in the form <code>file:///</code> and
    <code>file://localhost/</code>, i.e. only when the URL refers to a local file.</p>

    <p>You may enable support for HTTP and FTP URLs by implementing and installing
    a NetAccessor object. When a NetAccessor object is installed, the URL class
    will use it to create input streams for the remote entities refered to by such URLs.</p>


    </a>
  </faq>

  <faq title="How can I add support for URL's with HTTP/FTP protocols?">
    <q>How can I add support for URL's with HTTP/FTP protocols?</q>
    <a>
      <p>To address the need to make remote connections to resources
      specified using other protocols like HTTP, FTP etc..., Xerces-C
      now provides the <code>NetAccessor</code> interface. The header
      file is <code>src/util/XMLNetAccessor.hpp</code>. This interface
      allows you to plug in your own implementation of URL networking
      code into the Xerces-C parser.</p>

      <p>One such implementation <em>(tested minimally under WinNT
      only)</em> is already provided in &XercesCName; source code
      drop, using <jump href="http://www.w3.org/Library/">W3C's Libwww
      library</jump>. Libwww is available for free and has been ported
      to various platforms. Click <jump
      href="build.html#BuildUsingLibwww">here</jump> to read how you
      can rebuild Xerces-C binaries with this implementation.</p>

      <p>Some more notes about the NetAccessor implementation using
      Libwww:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>This implementation only supports HTTP and does not return
      adequate error messages when connections cannot be made to the
      remote resources. It however illustrates how you can add support
      for HTTP and FTP URL's.</li>

        <li>The Xerces-C team will <em>NOT</em> be able to address any
      questions related to how things work in Libwww. You can get some
      help with Libwww by subscribing to the &lt;<jump
      href="mailto:www-lib-request@w3.org?subject=subscribe">www-lib@w3.org</jump>&gt;
      public mailing list.</li>

        <li>However, we will welcome any feedback on the design of the
      NetAccessor interface. Please send all such feedback to <jump
      href="mailto:xerces-dev@xml.apache.org">xerces-dev@xml.apache.org</jump>.</li>

        <li>You do not have to recompile &XercesCName; to plugin your
      NetAccessor implementation. You can simply point the static
      pointer variable <code>XMLPlatformUtils::fgNetAccessor</code> to
      an instance of your NetAccessor implementation. Please refer to
      the files <code>src/util/PlatformUtils.cpp</code> and
      <code>src/util/Platforms/Win32/Win32PlatformUtils.cpp</code> to
      see how we have done this simple illustrative
      implementation.</li>

  <faq title="Can I use &XercesCProjectName; to parse HTML?">
    <q>Can I use &XercesCProjectName; to parse HTML?</q>
    <a>
      <p>Yes, if it follows the XML spec rules. Most HTML, however,
        does not follow the XML rules, and will therefore generate XML
        well-formedness errors.</p>

  <faq title="I keep getting an error: &quot;invalid UTF-8 character&quot;. What's wrong?">
    <q>I keep getting an error: "invalid UTF-8 character". What's wrong?</q>
    <a>
      <p>There are many Unicode characters that are not allowed in
        your XML document, according to the XML spec. Typical
        disallowed characters are control characters, even if you
        escape them using the Character Reference form: See the XML
        spec, sections 2.2 and 4.1 for details. If the parser is
        generating this error, it is very likely that there's a
        character in there that you can't see.  You can generally use
        a UNIX command like "od -hc" to find it.</p>

      <p>Another reason for this error is that your file is in some
        non UTF/ASCII encoding but you gave no encoding="" string in
        your file to tell the parser what its real encoding is.</p>
    </a>
  </faq>

  <faq title="What encodings are supported by Xerces-C / XML4C?">
    <q>What encodings are supported by Xerces-C / XML4C?</q>
    <a>

      <p>Xerces-C has intrinsic support for ASCII, UTF-8, UTF-16
      (Big/Small Endian), UCS4 (Big/Small Endian), EBCDIC code pages IBM037 and
      IBM1140 encodings, ISO-8859-1 (aka Latin1) and Windows-1252. This means that it can parse
      input XML files in these above mentioned encodings.</p>

      <p>XML4C - the version of Xerces-C available from IBM - extends
      this set to include the encodings listed in the table below.</p>

      <table>
        <tr><td><em>Common Name</em></td><td><em>Use this name in XML</em></td></tr>
        <tr><td>8 bit Unicode</td>                <td>UTF-8</td></tr>

  <faq title="What character encoding should I use when creating XML documents?">
    <q>What character encoding should I use when creating XML documents?</q>
    <a>

      <p>The best choice in most cases is either utf-8 or utf-16.
      Advantages of these encodings include </p>

      <ul>
         <li>The best portability.  These encodings are more widely
         supported by XML processors than any others, meaning that
         your documents will have the best possible chance of being
         read correctly, no matter where they end up. </li>

         <li>Full international character support.  Both utf-8 and
         utf-16 cover the full Unicode character set, which
         includes all of the characters from all major national,
         international and industry character sets. </li>

         <li>Efficient.  utf-8 has the smaller storage requirements
         for documents that are primarily composed of of characters
         from the Latin alphabet.  utf-16 is more efficient for
         encoding Asian languages.  But both encodings cover
         all languages without loss.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The only drawback of utf-8 or utf-16 is that they are not
      the native text file format for most systems, meaning that
      common text file editors and viewers can not be directly used.</p>

      <p>A second choice of encoding would be any of the others listed in
      the table above.  This works best when the xml encoding is the same
      as the default system encoding on the machine where the
      XML document is being prepared, because the document will then
      display correctly as a plain text file.  For UNIX systems
      in countries speaking Western European languages, the encoding
      will usually be iso-8859-1.</p>

      <p>The versions of Xerces, both C and Java, distributed
      by IBM as XML4C and XML4J, include all of the encodings
      listed in the above table, on all platforms. </p>

      <p>A word of caution for Windows users: The default character set
      on Windows systems is windows-1252, not iso-8859-1.  While Xerces-c
      does recognize this Windows encoding, it is a poor choice for portable
      XML data because it is not widely recoginized by other XML processing
      tools.  If you are using a Windows based editing tool to generate
      XML, check which character set it generates, and make sure that the
      resulting XML specifies the correct name in the encoding="..." declaration.</p>

  <faq title="Is EBCDIC supported?">
    <q>Is EBCDIC supported?</q>

    <a>
    <p>Yes, &XercesCName; supports EBCDIC.  When creating EBCDIC encoded XML data,
    the preferred encoding is ibm1140.  Also supported is ibm037 (and its alternate name,
    ebcdic-cp-us); this encoding is almost the same as ibm1140, but it lacks the Euro
    symbol</p>

    <p>These two encodings, ibm1140 and ibm037, are available on both Xerces-C and
    IBM XML4C, on all platforms. </p>

    <p>On IBM System 390, XML4C also supports two alternative forms, ibm037-s390
    and ibm1140-s390.  These are similar to the base ibm037 and ibm1140 encodings,
    but with alternate mappings of the EBCDIC new-line character, which allows
    them to appear as normal text files on System 390s.  These encodings are not
    supported on other platforms, and should not be used for portable data.</p>

    <p>XML4C on System 390 and AS/400 also provides additional EBCDIC encodings, including
    those for the character sets of different countries.  The exact set supported
    will be platform dependent, and these encodings are not recommended for
    portable XML data.  </p>
