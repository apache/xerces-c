    <s2 title="Building on Windows NT/98">
        <p>&XercesCName; comes with Microsoft Visual C++ projects and workspaces to
        help you build &XercesCName;. The following describes the steps you need
        to build &XercesCName;.</p>

        <s3 title="Building &XercesCName; library">
            <p>To build &XercesCName; from it source (using MSVC), you will
            need to open the workspace containing the project. If you are
            building your application, you may want to add the &XercesCName;
            project inside your applications's workspace.</p>
            <p>The workspace containing the &XercesCName; project file and
            all other samples is:</p>
<source>&XercesCSrcInstallDir;\Projects\Win32\VC6\xerces-all\xerces-all.dsw</source>
            <p>Once you are inside MSVC, you need to build the project marked
            <em>XercesLib</em>.</p>
            <p>If you want to include the &XercesCName; project separately,
            you need to pick up:</p>
<source>&XercesCSrcInstallDir;\Projects\Win32\VC6\xerces-all\XercesLib\XercesLib.dsp</source>
            <p>You must make sure that you are linking your application with
            the &XercesCWindowsLib;.lib library and also make sure that
            the associated DLL is somewhere in your path.</p>
            <note>If you are working on the AlphaWorks version which uses ICU,
            you must have the ICU data DLL named <code>icudata.dll</code> available from your path
            setting. For finding out where you can
            get ICU from and build it, look at the <link anchor="BuildICU">How to Build ICU</link>.</note>

        </s3>
        <s3 title="Building samples">
            <p>Inside the same workspace (xerces-all.dsw), you'll find several other
            projects. These are for the samples. Select all the samples and right click
            on the selection. Then choose "Build (selection only)" to build all the
            samples in one shot.</p>
        </s3>
    </s2>

    <anchor name="BuildUNIX"/>
    <s2 title="Building on UNIX platforms">
        <p>&XercesCName; uses
        <jump href="http://www.gnu.org">GNU</jump> tools like
        <jump href="http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/autoconf.html">Autoconf</jump> and
        <jump href="http://www.gnu.org/software/make/make.html">GNU Make</jump>
        to build the system. You must first make sure you
        have these tools installed on your system before proceeding.
        If you don not have required tools, ask your system administrator
        to get them for you. These tools are free under the GNU Public Licence
        and may be obtained from the
        <jump href="http://www.gnu.org">Free Software Foundation</jump>.</p>

        <p><em>Do not jump into the build directly before reading this.</em></p>

        <p>Spending some time reading the following instructions will save you a
        lot of wasted time and support-related e-mail communication.
        The &XercesCName; build instructions are a little different from
        normal product builds. Specifically, there are some wrapper-scripts
        that have been written to make life easier for you. You are free
        not to use these scripts and use
        <jump href="http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/autoconf.html">Autoconf</jump> and
        <jump href="http://www.gnu.org/software/make/make.html">GNU Make</jump>
        directly, but we want to make sure you know what you are by-passing and
        what risks you are taking. So read the following instructions
        carefully before attempting to build it yourself.</p>

        <p>Besides having all necessary build tools, you also need to know what
        compilers we have tested &XercesCName; on. The following table lists the
        relevant platforms and compilers.</p>

        <table>
            <tr><td><em>Operating System</em></td><td><em>C++, C Compilers</em></td></tr>
            <tr><td>Redhat Linux 6.1</td><td>g++, gcc (egcs)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>AIX 4.2.1  and higher</td><td>xlC_r, xlc_r</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Solaris 2.6</td><td>CC, cc</td></tr>
            <tr><td>HP-UX 11</td><td>aCC, cc</td></tr>
        </table>

        <p>If you are not using any of these compilers, you are taking a calculated risk
        by exploring new grounds. Your effort in making &XercesCName; work on this
        new compiler is greatly appreciated and any problems you face can be addressed
        on the &XercesCName; <jump href="mailto:&XercesCEmailAddress;">mailing list</jump>.
        </p>

        <p><em>Differences between the UNIX platforms:</em> The description below is
        generic, but as every programmer is aware, there are minor differences
        within the various UNIX flavors the world has been bestowed with.
        The one difference that you need to watch out in the discussion below,
        pertains to the system environment variable for finding libraries.
        On <em>Linux and Solaris</em>, the environment variable name is called
        <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code>, on <em>AIX</em> it is <code>LIBPATH</code>,
        while on <em>HP-UX</em> it is <code>SHLIB_PATH</code>. The following
        discussion assumes you are working on Linux, but it is with subtle
        understanding that you know how to interpret it for the other UNIX flavors.</p>

        <note>If you wish to build &XercesCName; with ICU,
        look at the <link anchor="BuildICU">Building ICU</link>.
        It tells you where you can get ICU and how to build &XercesCName; with it.</note>

        <s3 title="Setting build environment variables">
            <p>Before doing the build, you must first set your environment variables
            to pick-up the compiler and also specify where you extracted &XercesCName;
            on your machine.
            While the first one is probably set for you by the system administrator, just
            make sure you can invoke the compiler. You may do so by typing the
            compiler invocation command without any parameters (e.g. xlc_r, or g++, or cc)
            and check if you get a proper response back.</p>
            <p>Next set your &XercesCName; root path as follows:</p>
<source>export XERCESCROOT=&lt;full path to &XercesCSrcInstallDir;&gt;</source>

            <p>This should be the full path of the directory where you extracted &XercesCName;.</p>
            </s3>

        <s3 title="Building &XercesCName; library">
            <p>As mentioned earlier, you must be ready with the GNU tools like
            <jump href="http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/autoconf.html">autoconf</jump> and
            <jump href="http://www.gnu.org/software/make/make.html">gmake</jump>
            before you attempt the build.</p>

            <p>The autoconf tool is required on only one platform and produces
            a set of portable scripts (configure) that you can run on all
            other platforms without actually having the autoconf tool installed
            everywhere. In all probability the autoconf-generated script
            (called <code>configure</code>) is already in your <code>src</code>
            directory. If not, type:</p>

<source>cd $XERCESCROOT/src
autoconf</source>

            <p>This generates a shell-script called <code>configure</code>. It is tempting to run
            this script directly as is normally the case, but wait a minute. If you are
            using the default compilers like
            <jump href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gcc/gcc.html">gcc</jump> and
            <jump href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gcc/gcc.html">g++</jump> you do not have a problem. But
            if you are not on the standard GNU compilers, you need to export a few more
            environment variables before you can invoke configure.</p>

            <p>Rather than make you to figure out what strange environment
            variables you need to use, we have provided you with a wrapper
            script that does the job for you. All you need to tell the script
            is what your compiler is, and what options you are going to use
            inside your build, and the script does everything for you. Here
            is what the script takes as input:</p>

<source>runConfigure
runConfigure: Helper script to run "configure" for one of the
              supported platforms.
Usage: runConfigure "options"
       where options may be any of the following:
       -p &lt;platform&gt; (accepts 'aix', 'linux', 'solaris',
                            'hp-10', 'hp-11', 'irix', 'unixware')
       -c &lt;C compiler name&gt; (e.g. xlc_r, gcc, cc)
       -x &lt;C++ compiler name&gt; (e.g. xlC_r, g++, CC, aCC)
       -d (specifies that you want to build debug version)
       -m &lt;message loader&gt; can be 'inmem', 'icu', 'iconv'
       -n &lt;net accessor&gt; can be 'fileonly', 'libwww'
       -t &lt;transcoder&gt; can be 'icu' or 'native'
       -r &lt;thread option&gt; can be 'pthread' or 'dce' (only used on HP-11)
       -l &lt;extra linker options&gt;
       -z &lt;extra compiler options&gt;
       -h (to get help on the above commands)</source>

            <note>&XercesCName; can be built as either a standalone library or as a library
            dependent on International Components for Unicode (ICU). For simplicity,
            the following discussion only explains standalone builds.</note>

            <p>One of the common ways to build &XercesCName; is as follows:</p>

<source>runConfigure -plinux -cgcc -xg++ -minmem -nfileonly -tnative</source>

            <p>The response will be something like this:</p>

Still cannot resolve it? Find out if someone else had the same problem before.
Check the mailing list archives at http://archive.covalent.net.

In future, you may also directly type the following commands to create the Makefiles.

export TRANSCODER=NATIVE
export MESSAGELOADER=INMEM
export USELIBWWW=0
export CC=gcc
export CXX=g++
export CXXFLAGS=-O -DXML_USE_NATIVE_TRANSCODER -DXML_USE_INMEM_MESSAGELOADER
export CFLAGS=-O -DXML_USE_NATIVE_TRANSCODER -DXML_USE_INMEM_MESSAGELOADER
export LIBS= -lpthread
configure

If the result of the above commands look OK to you, go to the directory
XERCESCROOT and type "gmake" to make the XERCES-C system.</source>

<note>The error message concerning <code>conf.h</code>
is NOT an indication of a problem. This code has been inserted to make it
work on AS/400, but it gives this message which appears to be an error. The problem
will be fixed in future.</note>

            <p>So now you see what the wrapper script has actually been doing! It has
            invoked <code>configure</code>
            to create the Makefiles in the individual sub-directories, but in addition
            to that, it has set a few environment variables to correctly configure
            your compiler and compiler flags too.</p>

            <p>Now that the Makefiles are all created, you are ready to do the actual build.</p>

<source>gmake</source>

            <p>Is that it? Yes, that's all you need to build &XercesCName;.</p>
        </s3>

        <s3 title="Building samples">
            <p>Similarly, you can build the samples by giving the same commands in the
            <code>samples</code> directory.</p>

<source>cd $XERCESCROOT/samples
runConfigure -plinux -cgcc -xg++
gmake</source>

            <p>The samples get built in the <code>bin</code> directory. Before you run the
            samples, you must make sure that your library path is set to pick up
            libraries from <code>$XERCESCROOT/lib</code>. If not, type the following to
            set your library path properly.</p>

<source>export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$XERCESCROOT/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH</source>
            <p>You are now set to run the sample applications.</p>

        <s3 title="Building &XercesCName; library">
            <p><em>Requirements:</em></p>

             <p>There are two ways to build &XercesCName;. The "From Existing" method only
                  requires VAC++. The "From Scratch" method requires both Object Rexx and VAC++
                  installed.</p>

          <s3 title="The &quot;From Existing&quot; Method">
          <ol>
            <li>In the <code>&XercesCSrcInstallDir;\Projects\OS2\VACPP40</code> directory,
            find and edit the VAC++ configuration file <code>project_options.icc</code>.</li>

            <li>Change the directory on the first line <code>'BASE_DIR = "..."'</code>
            to match the base directory of the Xerces-C sources on your system.
            Note that the directory path must use double backslashes <code>"\\"</code>!</li>

            <li>Save <code>project_options.icc</code></li>

            <li>Start the Command Line in the VAC++ folder.</li>

            <li>Navigate to the <code>&XercesCSrcInstallDir;\Projects\OS2\VACPP40</code> directory.</li>

            <li>Run <code>build.cmd</code>. This does a migration build.</li>

            <li>When <code>build.cmd</code> finishes, review the file <code>compiler.errors</code>.
            This file should contain only informational messages, almost all complaining
            about constant values in comparisons.</li>

            <li>You should now have a <code>xerces-c.dll</code> and <code>xerces-c.lib</code>.
            The library file is an import library for the DLL.</li>
          </ol>
          </s3>

          <s3 title="The &quot;From Scratch&quot; Method">
          <ol>
            <li>If you are not currently running <code>Object Rexx</code>,
            run the <code>SWITCHRX</code> command from a command line,
            answer <code>"yes"</code> to switching to <code>Object Rexx</code>, and follow the
            instructions to reboot. You can switch back to <code>"Classic Rexx"</code> by running
            <code>SWITCHRX</code> again. But you probably won't need to switch back since
            <code>Object Rexx</code> runs almost 100% of Classic Rexx programs.</li>

            <li>In the <code>&XercesCSrcInstallDir;\Projects\OS2\VACPP40</code> directory,
            run <code>genICC.cmd</code>. This builds the VAC++ configuration files for
            the sources you have on your system.</li>

            non-OS/2 platform stuff. This happens when new platform-specific directories
            are added to Xerces. If they did pick up new non-OS/2 stuff, either edit it out
            of the <code>ICC</code> file or add them to the "ignore" array in <code>genICC.cmd</code> and

            <li>When <code>build.cmd</code> finishes, review the file <code>compiler.errors</code>.
            This file should contain only informational messages, almost all complaining about constant
            values in comparisons.</li>

            <li>You should now have a <code>xerces-c.dll</code> and <code>xerces-c.lib</code>.

         <s3 title="Packaging the Binaries">

          <p>There is an <code>Object Rexx</code> program that will package the binaries and headers.
          (See step 1 of the "From scratch" method on how to switch to <code>Object Rexx</code>.) The
          <code>packageBinaries.cmd</code> file is in the <code>&XercesCSrcInstallDir;\Projects\OS2\VACPP40</code>
          directory. Run <code>packageBinaries</code>, giving the source and target directories
          like this:</p>

          <source>packageBinaries -s x:\&XercesCSrcInstallDir; -o x:\temp\&XercesCInstallDir;-os2</source>

          anything you want.)</p>

          <note>If you don't want to use the <code>Object Rexx</code> program, you'll need to
          manually  copy the "*.hpp" and "*.c" files to an include directory.

           &XercesCName; natively on the AS/400.
            </p>
            <s3 title="Building &XercesCName; library">

                </ul>

                <p><em>Recommendations:</em></p>

                <ul>
                <li>There are a couple of options when building the XML4C parser on AS/400.
                For messaging support, you can use the in memory message option or the
                message file support. For code page translation, you can use the AS/400
                native <code>Iconv400</code> support or ICU. If you choose ICU, follow the instructions
                to build the ICU service program with the ICU download. Those instructions
                are not included here.</li>

                <li>Currently we recommend that you take the options of <code>MsgFile</code> and
                <code>Iconv400</code> (see below)</li>
                </ul>

                <p><em>Setup Instructions:</em></p>

                <ul>
                <li>Make sure that you have the requirements installed on your AS/400.
                We highly recommend that you read the writeup that accompanies the gnu
                facilities download.  There are install instructions as well as
                information about how modules, programs and service programs can be
                created in Unix-like fashion using gnu utilities.  Note that symbolic
                links are use in the file system to point to actual AS/400 <code>*module</code>,
                <code>*pgm</code> and <code>*srvpgm</code> objects in libraries.</li>
                <li>Download the tar file  (unix version) to the AS/400
                (using a mapped drive), and decompress and <code>untar</code> the source.
                We have had difficulty with the tar command on AS/400. This is under
                investigation.  If you have trouble, we recommend the following work
                around:</li></ul>
<source>
qsh:
gunzip -d &lt;tar file.gz&gt;
pax -r -f &lt;uncompressed tar file&gt;</source>

                <ul>
                <li>Create AS400 target library. This library will be the target
                for the resulting  modules and  &XercesCName; service program. You will
                specify this library on the <code>OUTPUTDIR</code> environment variable
                in step 4</li>
                <li>Set up the following environment variables in your build process
                (use <code>ADDENVVAR</code> or <code>WRKENVVAR CL</code> commands):</li>
                </ul>
<source>
XERCESCROOT - &lt;the full path to your &XercesCName; sources&gt;
PLATFORM  - 'OS400'
MAKE   - '/usr/bin/gmake'
OUTPUTDIR  - &lt;identifies target as400 library for *module, *pgm and *srvpgm objects&gt;
ICUROOT - (optional if using ICU)  &lt;the path of your ICU includes&gt;</source>

                <ul>
                <li>Add <code>QCXXN</code>, to your build process library list.
                This results in the resolution of <code>CRTCPPMOD</code> used by the
                <code>icc</code> compiler.</li>

                <li>The runConfigure instruction below uses <code>'egrep'</code>.
                This is not on the AS/400 but you can create it by doing the following:
                <code>edtf '/usr/bin/egrep'</code> with the following source:</li>
                </ul>

<source>
#!/usr/bin/sh
/usr/bin/grep -e "$@"</source>

<p>You may want to put the environment variables and library list
setup instructions in a <code>CL</code> program so you will not forget these steps
during your build.</p>

<p><em>Configure</em></p>

<p>To configure the make files for an AS/400 build do the following:</p>
<source>
qsh
cd &lt;full path to &XercesCName;&gt;/src
runConfigure -p os400 -x icc -c icc -m MsgFile -t Iconv400</source>

<p>Troubleshooting:</p>
<source>error: configure: error: installation or configuration problem:
C compiler cannot create executables.</source>

<p>If during <code>runConfigure</code> you see the above error message, it
can mean one of two things. Either <code>QCXXN</code> is not on your library
list  <em>OR</em> the <code>runConfigure</code> cannot create the temporary
modules (<code>CONFTest1</code>, etc) it uses to test out the compiler
options. The second reason happens because the test modules already exist
from a previous run of <code>runConfigure</code>. To correct the problem,
do the following:</p>
<source>
DLTMOD &lt;your OUTPUTDIR library&gt;/CONFT* and
DLTPGM your &lt;OUTPUTDIR library&gt;/CONFT*</source>

<p><em>Build</em></p>

<source>
qsh
gmake -e</source>

<p>The above gmake will result in a service program being created
in your specified library and a symbolic link to that service program
placed in &lt;path to &XercesCName;/lib&gt;. You can either bind your
XML application programs directly to the parser's service program
via the <code>BNDSRVPGM</code> option on the <code>CRTPGM</code> or
<code>CRTSRVPGM</code> command  or you can specify a binding directory
on your <code>icc</code>  command. To specify an archive file to bind to,
use the  <code>-L, -l</code> binding options on icc.  An archive file
on AS/400 is a binding directory. To create an archive file, use
<code>qar</code> command.  (see the gnu facilities write up).
</p>

<p>
After building the &XercesCName; service program, create a binding directory
by doing the following (note, this binding directory is used when building
the samples):</p>
<source>
qsh
cd &lt;full path to &XercesCName;>/lib&gt;
qar -cuv libxercesc1_1.a *.o
command = CRTBNDDIR BNDDIR(yourlib/libxercesc) TEXT('/yourlib/&XercesCName;/lib/libxercesc1_1.a')
command = ADDBNDDIRE BNDDIR(yourlib/libxercesc) OBJ((yourlib/LIBXERCESC *SRVPGM) )</source>


<p><em>Troubleshooting:</em></p>
<p>If you are on a V4R3 system, you will get a bind problem
<code>'descriptor  QlgCvtTextDescToDesc not found'</code> using Iconv400.
On V4R3 the system doesn't automatically pick up the <code>QSYS/QLGUSR</code> service
program for you when resolving this function. This is not the case on V4R4.
To fix this, you can either manually create the service program after creating
all the resulting modules in your &lt;OUTPUTDIR&gt; library or you can create
a symbolic link to a binding directory that points to  the <code>QLGUSR</code>
service program and then specify  an additional <code>-L, -l</code> on the
<code>EXTRA_LINK_OPTIONS</code> in <code>Makefile.incl</code>.
See the <code>ln</code> and <code>qar</code> function in the gnu utilities.</p>

<p>To build for transcoder ICU:</p>
<ol>
 <li>Make sure you have an <code>ICUROOT</code> path set up so that you can
 find the ICU header files (usually <code>/usr/local</code>)</li>
 <li>Make sure you have created a binding directory (symbolic link)
 in the file system so that you can bind the &XercesCName; service program
 to the ICU service program and specify that on the <code>EXTRA_LINK_OPTIONS</code>
 in <code>src/Makefile.incl</code> (usually the default is a link
 in <code>/usr/local/lib</code>).</li>
</ol>

<p><em>Creating AS400 XML parser message file:</em></p>
<p>As specified earlier, the <code>-m</code> MsgFile support on the
<code>runConfigure</code> enable the parser messages to be pulled from
an AS/400 message file. To view the source for creating  the message file
and the XML parser messages, see the following stream file:</p>
<source>
EDTF &lt;full path to &XercesCName;&gt;/src/util/MsgLoaders/MsgFile/CrtXMLMsgs</source>

<p>In the prolog of <code>CrtXMLMsgs</code> there are instructions to create
the message file:</p>
<ol>
<li>Use the <code>CPYFRMSTMF</code> to copy the CL source to an AS/400 source
physical file. Note that the target source file needs to have record length
of about 200 bytes to avoid any truncation.</li>
<li>Create the CL program to create the message file and add the various
message descriptions</li>
<li>Call the CL program, providing the name of the message file
(use <code>QXMLMSG</code> as default) and a library  (this can be any
library, including any product library in which you wish to embed
the xml parser)</li>
</ol>

<p>Note that the &XercesCName; source code for resolving parser messages is
using by default message file  <code>QXMLMSG, *LIBL</code>.
If you want to change either the message file name or explicitly qualify the
library to match your product needs, you must edit the following <code>.cpp</code>
files prior to your build.</p>
<source>
&lt;full path to &XercesCName;&gt;/src/util/MsgLoaders/MsgFile/MsgLoader.cpp
&lt;full path to &XercesCName;&gt;/src/util/Platforms/OS400/OS400PlatformUtils.cpp</source>

<p><em>Troubleshooting:</em></p>
<p>If you are using the parser and are failing to get any  message text
for error codes, it may be because of the <code>*LIBL</code> resolution of
the message file.</p>
</s3>

<s3 title="Building Samples on AS/400">
<source>
qsh
cd &lt;full path to &XercesCName;&gt;/samples
runConfigure -p os400 -x icc -c icc
gmake -e</source>

<p><em>Troubleshooting:</em></p>
<p>If you take a <code>'sed'</code> error, while trying to make the samples.
This is an AS400 anomaly having to do with certain new line character and
the <code>sed</code> function. A temporary work around is to use <code>EDTF</code>
on the configure stream file (<code>../samples/configure</code>) and delete the
following line near the bottom: <code>s%@DEFS@%$DEFS%g</code>.

        <p>As mentioned earlier, &XercesCName; may be built in stand-alone mode using
        native encoding support and also using ICU where you get support over 180
        different encodings. ICU stands for International Components for Unicode and is an
        open source distribution from IBM. You can get
        <jump href="http://oss.software.ibm.com/icu/">ICU libraries</jump> from

        <s3 title="Buiding ICU for &XercesCName;">
            <p>You can find generic instructions to build ICU in the ICU documentation.
            What we describe below are the minimal steps needed to build ICU for &XercesCName;.
            Not all ICU components need to be built to make it work with &XercesCName;.</p>

            <note><em>Important:</em> Please remember that <em>ICU and
            &XercesCName; must be built with the same compiler</em>,
            preferably with the same version. You cannot for example,
            build ICU with a threaded version of the xlC compiler and
            build &XercesCName; with a non-threaded one.</note>
        </s3>

        <s3 title="Building ICU on Windows">
            <p>To build ICU from its source, invoke the project
            <code>\icu\source\allinone\allinone.dsw</code>
            and build the sub-project labeled <code>all</code>.
            </p>

            <p>You must make sure that you are linking your application
            with the &XercesCWindowsLib;.lib library and also make sure
            that the associated &XercesCName; DLL is somewhere in your path. Note
            that at runtime, your application will need the ICU data DLL called

            <p>First make sure that you have defined the following
            environment variables:</p>

<source>export ICUROOT = &lt;icu_installdir&gt;</source>

            <p>Next, go to the directory, the following commands will create

            <p>You will get a more detailed description of the use of
            configure in the ICU documentation. The differences lie in the
            arguments passed to the configure script, which is a
            platform-independent generated shell-script (through

        <li>Perl 5.004 or higher</li>
        <li>Cygwin tools or MKS Toolkit</li>
        <li>zip.exe</li>
        </ul>

        <p></p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Steps are:</p>
        <ol>
        <li>Download the appropriate ICU source archive.</li>
        <li>Download Xerces-C source archive.</li>
        <li>Build ICU.</li>
        <li>Build Xerces-C with ICU.</li>
        </ol>

        <p></p>

        <p>Download Xerces-C from <jump href="http://xml.apache.org/xerces-c/dist">
        http://xml.apache.org/xerces-c/dist</jump> directory.</p>

        <p>Download the appropriate archive for ICU from: <jump
        href="http://oss.software.ibm.com/developerworks/opensource/icu/project/download/index.html">http://oss.software.ibm.com/developerworks/opensource/icu/project/download/index.html</jump>
        </p>


        <p>For Windows</p>

        <p>Extract Xerces-C source files from the .zip archive using WinZip, say
        in the root directory (an arbitrary drive x:). It should create a directory like
        '<code>x:\&XercesCSrcInstallDir;</code>'.</p>

        <p>Extract the ICU files, using WinZip, in root directory of the disk
        where you have installed Xerces-C, sources. After extraction, there
        should be a new directory '<code>x:\icu</code>' which contains all the ICU
        source files.</p>

        <p>There are two options to build Xerces-C with ICU. One is to use the
        MSDEV GUI environment, and the other is to invoke the compiler from the
        command line.</p>

        <p>Using, the GUI environment, requires one to edit the project files.
        Here, we will describe only the second option. It involves using the
        perl script '<code>packageBinaries.pl</code>'.</p>

        <p>Start a command prompt to get a new shell window. Make sure you have
        perl, cygwin tools (<code>uname</code>, <code>rm</code>,
        <code>cp</code>, ...), and <code>zip.exe</code> somewhere in the
        path. Next setup the environment for MSVC using
        '<code>VCVARS32.BAT</code>' or a similar file. Next at the prompt
        enter:</p>

        <source>set XERCESCROOT=x:\&XercesCSrcInstallDir;
set ICUROOT=x:\icu
cd x:\&XercesCSrcInstallDir;\scripts
perl packageBinaries.pl -s x:\&XercesCSrcInstallDir; -o x:\temp\&XercesCInstallDir;-win32 -t icu</source>

        <p>(Match the source directory to your system; the target directory can be
        anything you want.)</p>

        <p>If everything is setup right and works right, then you should see a
        binary drop created in the target directory specified above. This script
        will build both ICU and Xerces-C, copy the files (relevant to the binary
        drop) to the target directory.</p>

        <p>For a description of options available, you can enter:</p>
          <source>perl packageBinaries.pl</source>

    <s2 title="How to build XML for COM on Windows">

        <p>To build the COM module for use with XML on Windows platforms, you
        must first set up your machine appropriately with necessary tools and
        software modules and then try to compile it. The end result is an additional
        library that you can use along with the standard &XercesCName; for writing
        VB templates or for use with IE 5.0 using JavaScript.</p>

        <s3 title="Setting up your machine for COM">
        <p>To build the COM project you will need to install the MS PlatformSDK.
        Some of the header files we use don't come with Visual C++ 6.0. You may
        download it from Microsoft's Website at <jump href="http://www.microsoft.com/msdownload/platformsdk/setuplauncher.htm">http://www.microsoft.com/msdownload/platformsdk/setuplauncher.htm</jump>
        or directly FTP it from <jump href="ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/developr/PlatformSDK/April2000/Msi/WinNT/x86/InstMsi.exe">ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/developr/PlatformSDK/April2000/Msi/WinNT/x86/InstMsi.exe</jump>.</p>

        <p>The installation is huge, but you don't need most of it. So you
        may do a <em>custom install</em> by just selecting "Build Environment" and
        choosing the required components. First select the top level Platform SDK.
        Then click the down arrow and make all of the components unavailable. Next open the
        "Build Environment" branch and select only the following items:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Win32 API</li>
        <li>Component Services</li>
        <li>Web Services - Internet Explorer</li>
        </ul>

        <p><em>Important:</em> When the installation is complete you need to update VC6's
        include path to include <code>..\platformsdk\include\atl30</code>. You do this by
        choosing "Tools -> Options -> Directories". This path
        should be placed <ref>second</ref> after the normal PlatformSDK include.
        You change the order of the paths by clicking the up and down arrows.</p>

        <note>The order in which the directories appear on your path is important. Your
        first include path should be <code>..\platformsdk\include</code>. The second one
        should be <code>..\platformsdk\include\atl30</code>.</note>
        </s3>

        <s3 title="Building COM module for &XercesCName;">
        <p>Once you have set up your machine, build &XercesCName; COM module
        by choosing the project named 'xml4com' inside the workspace. Then select your
        build mode to be <em>xml4com - Win32 Release MinDependency</em>. Finally build the
        project. This will produce a DLL named <code>xerces-com.dll</code> which needs
        to be present in your path (on local machine) before you can use it.</p>
        </s3>

        <s3 title="Testing the COM module">
        <p>There are some sample test programs in the <code>test/COMTest</code>
        directory which show examples of navigating and searching an XML tree
        using DOM. You need to browse the HTML files in this directory using
        IE 5.0. Make sure that your build has worked properly, specially the
        registration of the ActiveX controls that happens in the final step.</p>
        <p>You may also want to check out the NIST DOM test suite at
        <jump href="http://xw2k.sdct.itl.nist.gov/BRADY/DOM/">http://xw2k.sdct.itl.nist.gov/BRADY/DOM/</jump>.
        You will have to modify the documents in the NIST suite to load the
        Xerces COM object instead of the MSIE COM object.</p>

    <anchor name="BuildDocs"/>
    <s2 title="How to build the User Documentation?">

        <p>The user documentation (this very page that you are reading
        on the browser right now), was generated using an XML
        application called StyleBook. This application makes use of
        Xerces-J and Xalan to create the HTML file from the XML source
        files. The XML source files for the documentation are part of
        the &XercesCName; module. These files reside in the
        <code>doc</code> directory.</p>

        <p><em>Pre-requisites for building the user
        documentation are:</em></p>

        <ul>
          <li>JDK 1.2.2 (or later).</li>
          <li>Xerces-J 1.0.1.<em>bundled</em></li>
          <li>Xalan-J 0.19.2.<em>bundled</em></li>
          <li>Stylebook 1.0-b2.<em>bundled</em></li>
          <li>The Apache Style files (dtd's and .xsl files).<em>bundled</em></li>
        </ul>

        <p>Invoke a command window and setup PATH to include the JDK 1.2.2 bin
        directory</p>

        <p>Next, cd to the &XercesCName; source drop root directory,
        and enter</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Under Windows:<br/>
          <code>createDocs</code></li>
          <li>Under Unix's:<br/>
          <code>sh createDocs.bat</code></li>
        </ul>

        <p>This should generate the .html files in the 'doc/html'
        directory.</p>

    <anchor name="PortingGuide"/>
    <s2 title="I wish to port &XercesCProjectName; to my favourite platform. Do you have any suggestions?">

      <p>All platform dependent code in &XercesCProjectName; has been
      isolated to a couple of files, which should ease the porting
      effort.  Here are the basic steps that should be followed to
      port &XercesCProjectName;.</p>

      <ol>

        <li>The directory <code>src/util/Platforms</code> contains the
        platform sensitive files while <code>src/util/Compilers</code> contains
        all development environment sensitive files. Each operating
        system has a file of its own and each development environment
        has another one of its own too.

        <br/>

        As an example, the Win32 platform as a <code>Win32Defs.hpp</code> file
        and the Visual C++ environment has a <code>VCPPDefs.hpp</code> file.
        These files set up certain define tokens, typedefs,
        constants, etc... that will drive the rest of the code to
        do the right thing for that platform and development
        environment. AIX/CSet have their own <code>AIXDefs.hpp</code> and
        <code>CSetDefs.hpp</code> files, and so on. You should create new
        versions of these files for your platform and environment
        and follow the comments in them to set up your own.
        Probably the comments in the Win32 and Visual C++ will be
        the best to follow, since that is where the main
        development is done.</li>

        <li>Next, edit the file <code>XML4CDefs.hpp</code>, which is where all
            of the fundamental stuff comes into the system. You will
            see conditional sections in there where the above
            per-platform and per-environment headers are brought in.
            Add the new ones for your platform under the appropriate
            conditionals.</li>

        <li>Now edit <code>AutoSense.hpp</code>. Here we set canonical &XercesCProjectName;
            internal <code>#define</code> tokens which indicate the platform and
            compiler. These definitions are based on known platform
            and compiler defines.
            <br/>
            <code>AutoSense.hpp</code> is included in <code>XML4CDefs.hpp</code> and the
            canonical platform and compiler settings thus defined will
            make the particular platform and compiler headers to be
            the included at compilation.
            <br/>
            It might be a little tricky to decipher this file so be
            careful. If you are using say another compiler on Win32,
            probably it will use similar tokens so that the platform
            will get picked up already using what is already there.</li>

        <li>Once this is done, you will then need to implement a
            version of the <ref>platform utilities</ref> for your platform.
            Each operating system has a file which implements some
            methods of the XMLPlatformUtils class, specific to that
            operating system. These are not terribly complex, so it
            should not be a lot of work. The Win32 verions is called
            <code>Win32PlatformUtils.cpp</code>, the AIX version is
            <code>AIXPlatformUtils.cpp</code> and so on. Create one for your
            platform, with the correct name, and empty out all of the
            implementation so that just the empty shells of the
            methods are there (with dummy returns where needed to make
            the compiler happy.) Once you've done that, you can start
            to get it to build without any real implementation.</li>

        <li>Once you have the system building, then start
            implementing your own platform utilties methods. Follow
            the comments in the Win32 version as to what they do, the
            comments will be improved in subsequent versions, but they
            should be fairly obvious now. Once you have these
            implementations done, you should be able to start
            debugging the system using the demo programs.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>That is the work required in a nutshell!</p>

    <anchor name="WCharT"/>
    <s2 title="What should I define XMLCh to be?  And what is the
               relationship between XMLCh and wchar_t?">

        <p>XMLCh should be defined to be a type suitable for holding a
           utf-16 encoded (16 bit) value, usually an <code>unsigned short</code>. </p>

        <p>All XML data is handled within xerces-c as strings of
           XMLCh characters.  Regardless of the size of the
           type chosen, the data stored in variables of type XMLCh
           will always be utf-16 encoded values. </p>



        <p>Unlike XMLCh, the  encoding
               of wchar_t is platform dependent.  Sometimes it is utf-16
               (AIX, Windows), sometimes ucs-4 (Solaris,
               Linux), sometimes it is not based on Unicode at all
               (HP/UX, AS/400, system 390).  </p>

        <p>Some earlier releases of xerce-c defined XMLCh to be the
           same type as wchar_t on most platforms, with the goal of making
           it possible to pass XMLCh strings to library or system functions
           that were expecting wchar_t paramters.  This approach has
           been abandonded because of</p>

           <ul>
              <li>
                 Portability problems with any code that assumes that
                 the types of XMLCh and wchar_t are compatible
              </li>

              <li>Excessive memory usage, especially in the DOM, on
                  platforms with 32 bit wchar_t.
              </li>

              <li>utf-16 encoded XMLCh is not always compatible with
                  ucs-4 encoded wchar_t on Solaris and Linux.  The
                  problem occurs with Unicode characters with values
                  greater than 64k; in ucs-4 the value is stored as
                  a single 32 bit quatity.  With utf-16, the value
                  will be stored as a "surrogate pair" of two 16 bit
                  values.  Even with XMLCh equated to wchar_t, xerces will
                  still create the utf-16 encoded surrogate pairs, which
                  are illegal in ucs-4 encoded wchar_t strings.
