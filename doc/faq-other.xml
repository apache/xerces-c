        <q>How do I determine the version of &XercesCName; I am using?</q>
        <a>

           <p>The version string for &XercesCName; is in one of the header files. Look
           inside the file <code>src/xercesc/util/XercesDefs.hpp</code> or, in the binary distribution, look in <code>include/xercesc/utils/XercesDefs.hpp</code>. Search for the static variable <code>gXercesFullVersionStr</code> and look at its definition. (It is usually a string like "1_4_0" or
           something similar). This is the version of &XercesCName; you are using.</p>

           <p>If you don't have the header files, you have to find the version
           information from the shared library name. On Windows right click on
           the DLL name &XercesCWindowsDLL;.dll in the bin directory and look up
           properties. The version information may be found on the Version tab.</p>

           <p>On AIX, just look for the library name &XercesCUnixLib;.a (or
           &XercesCUnixLib;.so on Solaris/Linux and &XercesCUnixLib;.sl on HP-UX). The
           version number is coded in the name of the library.</p>

  <faq title="Is there any kind of support available for &XercesCName;?">

    <q>Is there any kind of support available for &XercesCName;?</q>

    <a>

    <p>&XercesCName; comes with <em>no</em> formal support.</p>

      <p>Every volunteer project obtains its strength from the people involved in
        it. Mailing lists provide a simple and effective communication mechanism. You
        are welcome to join any of these mailing lists (or all of them if you wish).
        You can choose to lurk, or to actively participate. It's up to you. Before you
        join these lists, you should look over the resources in the Reference Library
        section</p>

      <p>Instructions for subscribing are at
        <jump
         href="http://xml.apache.org/mail.html">http://xml.apache.org/mail.html</jump>.

    <q>I have a patch to the &XercesCName; source code. How do I submit it?</q>

    <a>

      <p>Mail it to the <jump href="mailto:&XercesCEmailAddress;">&XercesCName;
        mailing list</jump>. There are no set rules about
        how or what must be included -- if you've fixed a problem or enhanced the code
        in some way, we really would like to get your changes, and will take them in
        any reasonable form.</p>

      <p>Generally a diff of the changed files against the current sources from
        CVS is good, along with some kind of description of what the change is.
        (Working with the current sources is important!)</p>
