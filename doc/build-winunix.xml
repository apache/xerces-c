    <s2 title="Building on Windows using Microsoft Visual C++">
        <p>&XercesCName; source distribution comes with Microsoft Visual C++ projects and solutions to
        help you build &XercesCName;. The following describes the steps you need
        to build &XercesCName;.</p>

        <s3 title="Building &XercesCName; library">
            <p>To build &XercesCName; from the source distribution (using MSVC), you will
            need to open the solution containing the project. If you are
            building your application, you may want to add the &XercesCName;
            project inside your application's solution.</p>
            <p>The solutions containing the &XercesCName; project files and
            all other samples are in the following sub-directories in the
            &XercesC3SrcInstallDir; directory:</p>

<source>
(For VC6)   Projects\Win32\VC6\xerces-all\xerces-all.dsw
(For VC7.1) Projects\Win32\VC7.1\xerces-all\xerces-all.sln
(For VC8)   Projects\Win32\VC8\xerces-all\xerces-all.sln
(For VC9)   Projects\Win32\VC9\xerces-all\xerces-all.sln
</source>

            <p>Once you have the solution open, you need to build the
               project marked <em>XercesLib</em>. You can select
               Debug/Release, Static/DLL, and, for VC8, 32/64 bit
               builds using the Configuration Manager dialog.</p>

            <p>If you want to include the &XercesCName; project into
               your own solution, you need to pick up:</p>
<source>
(For VC6)   Projects\Win32\VC6\xerces-all\XercesLib\XercesLib.dsp
(For VC7.1) Projects\Win32\VC7.1\xerces-all\XercesLib\XercesLib.vcproj
(For VC8)   Projects\Win32\VC8\xerces-all\XercesLib\XercesLib.vcproj
(For VC9)   Projects\Win32\VC9\xerces-all\XercesLib\XercesLib.vcproj
</source>

            <p>You must make sure that you are linking your application with
            the &XercesC3WindowsLib;.lib library (or Debug/Static version of it
            and also make sure that the associated DLL is somewhere in your
            path.</p>

            <note>If you are linking your application to a static library,
                  then you will need to compile your application with the
                  XML_LIBRARY preprocessor define in order
                  to turn off the DLL import/export mechanism. This is
                  also the case for the Mingw-msys platform.</note>

            <note>If you are working on the AlphaWorks version which uses ICU,
                  you must have the ICU data DLL named <code>icudata.dll</code>
                  available from your path setting.</note>

            <note>If the library is built with the ICU message loader,
                  or message catalog loader, then you need to make sure
                  the XERCESC_NLS_HOME environment variable points to the
                  $XERCESCROOT/msg directory where the message files reside.</note>

        </s3>
        <s3 title="Building samples">
            <p>If you are using the source package, inside the same solution
               (xerces-all.dsw or xerces-all.sln), you'll find several other
               projects. These are for the samples. Select all the samples
               and right click on the selection. Then choose "Build (selection
               only)" to build all the samples in one shot.</p>
        </s3>
    </s2>

    <anchor name="UNIX"/>
    <s2 title="Building on UNIX/Linux/Mac OS X platforms">

        <p>&XercesCName; uses
        <jump href="http://www.gnu.org/software/make/make.html">GNU make</jump>
        to build the libraries and samples. You must first make sure you
        have GNU make installed on your system before proceeding. On some
        platforms GNU make is called gmake instead of make.
        If you do not have GNU make, ask your system administrator
        to get it for you.</p>

        <p><em>Do not jump into the build directly before reading this.</em>
        Spending some time reading the following instructions will save
        you a lot of wasted time and support-related e-mail communication.</p>

        <p><em>Differences between the UNIX platforms:</em> The description below is
        generic, but as every programmer is aware, there are minor differences
        within the various UNIX flavors the world has been bestowed with.
        The one difference that you need to watch out in the discussion below,
        pertains to the system environment variable for finding libraries.
        On <em>Linux</em> and <em>Solaris</em>, the environment variable name is called
        <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code>, on <em>AIX</em> it is <code>LIBPATH</code>,
        on <em>Mac OS X</em> it is <code>DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH</code>,
        while on <em>HP-UX</em> it is <code>SHLIB_PATH</code>. The following
        discussion assumes you are working on Linux, but it is with subtle
        understanding that you know how to interpret it for the other UNIX flavors.</p>

        <s3 title="Setting build environment variables">
            <p>Before doing the build, you must first set your environment variables
            to pick-up the compiler.
            While the first one is probably set for you by the system administrator, just
            make sure you can invoke the compiler. You may do so by typing the
            compiler invocation command without any parameters (e.g. xlc_r, or g++, or cc)
            and check if you get a proper response back.</p>
        </s3>

        <s3 title="Building &XercesCName; library">
            <p>As mentioned earlier, to build &XercesCName; from the source distribution,
            you must be ready with the GNU tools like
            <jump href="http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/autoconf.html">autoconf</jump> and
            <jump href="http://www.gnu.org/software/make/make.html">gmake</jump>
            before you attempt the build.</p>

            <p>The autoconf tool is required on only one platform and produces
            a set of portable scripts (configure) that you can run on all
            other platforms without actually having the autoconf tool installed
            everywhere. In all probability the autoconf-generated script
            (called <code>configure</code>) is already in your <code>src/xercesc</code>
            directory. If not, type:</p>

<source>cd &lt;full path to &XercesC3SrcInstallDir;&gt;
./reconf</source>

            <p>This generates a shell-script called <code>configure</code>. It is tempting to run
            this script directly as is normally the case, but wait a minute.
			Even if you are using the default compilers like
            <jump href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gcc/gcc.html">gcc</jump> and
            <jump href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gcc/gcc.html">g++</jump>
            you need to make some decisions about what components you want to
            build into the library.</p>

            <p>You need to specify one options from each category; not specifying one
			will instruct <code>configure</code> to pick the best choice available:</p>


	<p>Net Accessor (used to read data from HTTP sources):</p>
		<ol>
			<li><code>--enable-netaccessor-curl</code> Uses curl</li>
			<li><code>--enable-netaccessor-libwww</code> Uses W3C's libWWW</li>
			<li><code>--enable-netaccessor-socket</code> Uses plain BSD sockets</li>
			<li><code>--enable-netaccessor-cfurl</code> Uses cfurl (Mac-only)</li>
			<li><code>--enable-netaccessor-winsock</code> Uses WinSock (Windows-only, either Cygwin or MinGW)</li>
		</ol>
	<p>Message Loader (used to store the strings of the error messages):</p>
		<ol>
			<li><code>--enable-msgloader-inmemory</code> Stores the messages in C++ arrays</li>
			<li><code>--enable-msgloader-icu</code> Stores the messages using ICU resource bundles</li>
			<li><code>--enable-msgloader-iconv</code> Stores the messages in a iconv message catalog</li>
		</ol>
	<p>Transcoder (used to convert strings between UTF-16 and any other supported encoding):</p>
		<ol>
			<li><code>--enable-transcoder-gnuiconv</code> Uses GNU iconv library</li>
			<li><code>--enable-transcoder-iconv</code> Uses iconv library</li>
			<li><code>--enable-transcoder-icu</code> Uses ICU library</li>
			<li><code>--enable-transcoder-macosunicodeconverter</code> Uses MacOS APIs (Mac-only)</li>
			<li><code>--enable-transcoder-windows</code> Uses Windows APIs (Windows-only, either Cygwin or MinGW)</li>
		</ol>

            <p>By default <code>configure</code> will build both shared and static libraries;
			you can use <code>--disable-shared</code> or <code>--disable-static</code> to
			suppress the version you don't need.</p>

            <p>Thread support is enabled by default too;
			you can use <code>--disable-threads</code> to remove it.</p>

            <p>If you need to specify a compiler (because more than one is found in the PATH,
			or because it has been renamed to a non-standard name), you should set the
			environment variables CXX and CC before invoking <code>configure</code>.<br/>
			If you need special compiler or linker options, define the environment variables
			CXXFLAGS and LDFLAGS.</p>

            <note>&XercesCName; can be built as either a standalone library or as a library
            dependent on International Components for Unicode (ICU). For simplicity,
            the following discussion only explains standalone builds.</note>

            <anchor name="configure-example"/>
            <p>The simplest way to build &XercesCName; is as follows:</p>

<source>./configure</source>

            <p>This will instruct <code>configure</code> to find out the platform, the compiler
			and the libraries installed on the system. If more than one library is available
			for a category, the most powerful will be chosen (e.g. if ICU is available, it will
			be chosen over iconv).<br/>
			So it's recommended to examine the log to check if its choices are the correct ones.</p>

    <s2 title="Building on Windows using Cygwin">
        <p><em>Do not jump into the build directly before reading this.</em></p>

	<p>&XercesCName; may be built in the
	<jump href="http://www.cygwin.com">Cygwin</jump> environment for use
	by Cygwin applications.  As with the <jump href="#UNIX">UNIX</jump>
	platforms, &XercesCName; on Cygwin uses
	<jump href="http://www.gnu.org">GNU</jump> tools.  Therefore, with a
	couple of notable exceptions, &XercesCName; on Cygwin is built using
	the same instructions as the UNIX platforms.  The build environment
	variable XERCESCROOT must be set to the proper path containing the
	&XercesCName; sources and <em>runConfigure</em> must be run with the
	"-p cygwin -c gcc -x g++" arguments.</p>

	<p>Cygwin's GCC also has the ability to build MinGW targeted binaries.
	This is supported via the -mno-cygwin compiler switch. In that case the
	arguments to runConfigure should be
	'-p mingw-msys -c gcc -x g++ -z -mno-cygwin -l -mno-cygwin -C --host=i686-mingw32'.
	Note that both the compiler and linker flags need to be set.</p>

	<p>Also note that Cygwin is different from the UNIX platforms in the way
	that it finds libraries at run time.  While UNIX platforms may use the
	environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH, Cygwin uses the PATH environment
	variable.</p>

	<p>By default, autoconf on Cygwin and MinGW/MSYS doesn't build shared libraries,
	   even if <code>configure</code> will detect it's possible; you will have to force
	   it by specifying the <code>LDFLAGS=-no-undefined</code> option to <code>configure</code>
	</p>

	<p>There is an issue with the gcc/g++ compiler version 2.95, where C++
	exceptions thrown from a DLL will cause the application to crash, regardless
	of whether there is a "catch" statement.  This bug doesn't occur in tests
	using gcc 3.1 or 3.2, so it is recommended that you use gcc 3.1 or higher.</p>

    <s2 title="Building on Windows using MinGW">
        <p><em>Do not jump into the build directly before reading this.</em></p>

	<p>&XercesCName; may be built in the

	&XercesCName; sources and <em>runConfigure</em> must be run with the
	"-pmingw-msys -cgcc -xg++" arguments. It is also possible to build
        &XercesCName; libraries for MinGW using Cygwin. For more information
        on how to do this see the <jump href="#CygWin">Building on Windows
        using Cygwin</jump> section.</p>

	<p>Note that MinGW is different from the UNIX platforms in the way
	that it finds libraries at run time.  While UNIX platforms may use the
	environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH, MinGW uses the PATH environment
	variable.</p>

	<p>When linking against the static version of &XercesCName;, be sure to
	use the '-DXML_LIBRARY' compiler flag. Otherwise the functions in the
	header files will be marked as to be imported from a DLL and the linker will fail.</p>

	<p>Also note that you can run into a bug found in older MinGW's dllwrap utility,
        which is used by &XercesCName; build system to link DLLs. For more information
	see the following <jump href="http://marc.info/?l=xerces-c-users&amp;m=118891009725180&amp;w=2">
