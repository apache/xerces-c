  <s2 title="Overview">
    <p>This page lists popular application and libraries that
       are based on or provide an additional functionality on
       top of &XercesCName;. If you know of an application that
       you feel should be listed here, send an email with all the
       relevant information to one of the <jump href="mailing-lists.html">
       &XercesCName; mailing lists</jump>.</p>

    <s3 title="CodeSynthesis XSD">
      <p><jump href="http://www.codesynthesis.com/products/xsd/">CodeSynthesis
         XSD</jump> is an open-source XML Schema to C++ data
         binding compiler that uses &XercesCName; as the underlying XML
         parser. Provided with an XML instance specification (XML Schema), XSD
         generates C++ classes that represent the given vocabulary as well
         as parsing and serialization code. You can then access the data
         stored in XML using types and functions that semantically
         correspond to your application domain rather than dealing with
         direct representations of XML such as DOM and SAX.</p>
