<title>Sample: SAX2Count</title>

    <section>
<title>SAX2Count</title>
        <p>SAX2Count is the simplest application that counts the elements and characters of
        a given XML file using the (event based) SAX2 API.</p>

        <section>
<title>Running SAX2Count</title>

          <p>The SAX2Count sample parses an XML file and prints out a count of the number of
          elements in the file. To run SAX2Count, enter the following </p>
          <source>perl SAX2Count.pl &lt;XML File&gt;</source>
          <p>The following parameters may be set from the command line </p>
<source>
Usage:
    perl SAX2Count.pl [options] &lt;XML file | List file&gt;

This program invokes the SAX2XMLReader, and then prints the
number of elements, attributes, spaces and characters found
in each XML file, using SAX2 API.

Options:
    -l          Indicate the input file is a List File that has a list of xml files.
                Default to off (Input file is an XML file).
    -v=xxx      Validation scheme [always | never | auto*].
    -n          Enable namespace processing. Defaults to off.
    -s          Ensable schema processing. Defaults to off.
<!--
    -f          Enable full schema constraint checking processing. Defaults to off.
    -locale=ll_CC specify the locale, default: en_US 
-->
    -h          Show this help.

  * = Default if not provided explicitly.
</source>
          <p><em>-v=always</em> will force validation<br/>
             <em>-v=never</em> will not use any validation<br/>
             <em>-v=auto</em> will validate if a DOCTYPE declaration or a schema declaration is present in the XML document</p>
          <p>Here is a sample output from SAX2Count</p>
<source>cd samples
perl SAX2Count.pl -v=always personal.xml
personal.xml: 60 ms (37 elems, 12 attrs, 134 spaces, 134 chars)</source>
          <p>Running SAX2Count with the validating parser gives a different result because
          ignorable white-space is counted separately from regular characters.</p>
<source>perl SAX2Count.pl -v=never personal.xml
personal.xml: 10 ms (37 elems, 12 attrs, 0 spaces, 268 chars)</source>
          <p>Note that the sum of spaces and characters in both versions is the same.</p>

          <note>The time reported by the program may be different depending on your
          machine processor.</note>
