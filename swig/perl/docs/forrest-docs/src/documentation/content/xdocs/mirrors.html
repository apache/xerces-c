<h1><a name="how" />How to download</h1>
<p class="note">
Please realise that Forrest is still pre-1.0 release version.
It is certainly usable for those who are prepared to move with it.
See more notes about <a href="index.html#status">status</a>.
</p>
<p>Use the links below to download a distribution of Apache Forrest from
one of our mirrors. It is good practice to 
<a href="[location]#verify">verify the integrity</a>
of the distribution files.</p>

<p>Apache Forrest is distributed as a <code>zip</code> archive (for Windows) and
as a <code>tar.gz</code> archive (for UNIX). The contents are the same,
the only difference is the line-endings of all text files.
</p>
<p>The distribution contains all of the source code, documentation,
and resources, together with the pre-built ready-to-run forrest binary.
</p>

[<a href="http://www.apache.org/dist/forrest/apache-forrest-0.7.tar.gz.asc">PGP</a>]

<h1><a name="svn" />Snapshots of current development and head SVN repository</h1>

<p>If you want to use the latest Apache Forrest features, the source code is under
version control with Subversion (read how to
<a href="site:documentation/developers/build">obtain</a> your working copy). There are
also compressed source 
<a href="http://svn.apache.org/snapshots/forrest/">snapshots</a> that are
packed every 6 hours.
</p>

<h1><a name="archive" />Archive of old releases</h1>

<p>Older releases are available in the <a
href="http://archive.apache.org/dist/forrest/">archive</a>.  Those
releases are only provided as historical artefacts. We strongly
recommend to not use those releases, but upgrade to the most recent release.
</p>

<h1><a name="verify" />Verify releases</h1>

<p>It is essential that you verify the integrity of the downloaded
files using the PGP and MD5 signatures.  MD5 verification ensures the
file was not corrupted during the download process.  PGP verification
ensures that the file came from a certain person.</p>

<p>The PGP signatures can be verified using
<a href="http://www.pgpi.org/">PGP</a> or
<a href="http://www.gnupg.org/">GPG</a>.
First download the Apache Forrest
<a href="http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/forrest/trunk/KEYS">KEYS</a>
as well as the <code>asc</code> signature file for the particular
distribution. It is important that you get these files from the ultimate
trusted source - the main ASF distribution site, rather than from a mirror.
Then verify the signatures using ...</p>

<pre>
% pgpk -a KEYS
% pgpv apache-forrest-X.Y.tar.gz.asc

<em>or</em>

% pgp -ka KEYS
% pgp apache-forrest-X.Y.tar.gz.asc

<em>or</em>

% gpg --import KEYS
% gpg --verify apache-forrest-X.Y.tar.gz.asc
</pre>

<p>To verify the MD5 signature on the files, you need to use a program
called <code>md5</code> or <code>md5sum</code>, which is
included in many unix distributions.  It is also available as part of
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/textutils/textutils.html">GNU
Textutils</a>.  Windows users can get binary md5 programs from <a
href="http://www.fourmilab.ch/md5/">here</a>, <a
href="http://www.pc-tools.net/win32/freeware/console/">here</a>, or
<a href="http://www.slavasoft.com/fsum/">here</a>.</p>

<p>We strongly recommend you verify your downloads with both PGP and MD5.</p>
