# Some design changes:
# o Changed the TokenFactory from a single static instance, to a
#    normal class. Each RegularExpression object will have its own
#    instance of TokenFactory, and that instance will be passed to
#    other classes that need to use a TokenFactory to create Token
#    objects (with the exception of RangeTokenMap).
# o Added a new class RangeTokenMap to map a the different ranges
#    in a given category to a specific RangeFactory object. In the old
#    design RangeFactory had dual functionality (act as a Map, and as
#    a factory for creating RangeToken(s)). The RangeTokenMap will
#    have its own copy of the TokenFactory. There will be only one
#    instance of the RangeTokenMap class, and that instance will be
#    lazily deleted when XPlatformUtils::Terminate is called.
