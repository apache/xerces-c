# Two ICU tools are run from this makefile:
#    genrb    compiles a resource source file (.txt) into
#             a binary .res file.
#    pkgdata  combines all of the .res files into a single
#             shared library that can then be linked with the
#             main application.
#
#             pkgdata will recursively generate and run yet
#             another makefile, which in turn runs two more
#             icu tools.  gencmn combines the individual .res
#             files, and genccode emits the data as C source
#             code that can then be built into a .so
#
