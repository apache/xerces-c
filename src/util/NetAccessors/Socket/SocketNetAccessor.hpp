 * $Log$
 * Revision 1.1  2000/03/20 23:48:51  rahulj
 * Added Socket based NetAccessor. This will enable one to
 * use HTTP URL's for system id's. Default build options do
 * not use this NetAccessor. Specify the '-n socket' option
 * to 'runConfigure' to configure Xerces-C to use this new
 * feature. The code works under Solaris 2.6, Linux, AIX
 * and HPUX 11 with aCC.
 * Todo's: enable proper error handling.
