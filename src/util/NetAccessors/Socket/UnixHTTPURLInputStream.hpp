/*
 * $Log$
 * Revision 1.3  2000/07/21 03:31:42  andyh
 * Improved (but still weak) http access by the parser.
 *
 * Revision 1.2  2000/03/22 00:58:12  rahulj
 * Now we throw exceptions when errors occur.
 * Simplified code based on assumption that calling
 * function will allocate enough storage to store the
 * incoming data.
 *
 * Revision 1.1  2000/03/20 23:48:51  rahulj
 * Added Socket based NetAccessor. This will enable one to
 * use HTTP URL's for system id's. Default build options do
 * not use this NetAccessor. Specify the '-n socket' option
 * to 'runConfigure' to configure Xerces-C to use this new
 * feature. The code works under Solaris 2.6, Linux, AIX
 * and HPUX 11 with aCC.
 * Todo's: enable proper error handling.
